Forex,My Personal Best,"Sorry if the text of this post doesn't really make sense but I just wanted to post because This moment has been a long time coming. I have 'finally' (i know some people don't ever see this amount of money in the markets) made 1k in a single trade and a single day (24 hours because technically i opened the trade last night). after losing several thousands of dollars over more than half a decade between shitty courses, funded account challenges, and personal trading account loses, I can finally say I have achieved 'The Big One'. To some of you this may seem like peanuts, to others it may be a life changing amount of money, but to me it is proof. Everyone in my life that I have told about my trading has doubted me and said I was making a mistake. While this may be just another trade to some this is about finally overcoming a milestone for me. 

  
With this trade I have been able to prove to myself that trading is a viable option for my future. I know that some of you will say that I am making a mistake by going down this route and that's ok. I am not a full time trader, Calling myself a part time trader might even be a little bit of an overstatement. I have a full time job and a Girlfriend so obviously I am not able to commit as much time as others to this endeavor but this is still a milestone mark for me. this trade is what proved to MYSELF that I am able to do this full time in the future. 

  
If you are able to read a tradingview chart you understand what happened but if not let me explain. I entered a trade for a GBPUSD buy on Monday night (EST) and it ended up in profit but I had moved my SL into profit and I got stopped out a little over 30 pips in profit, but I knew that there was more upward movement coming so I reentered the trade. Maintaining the confidence I had in my original position is what led to this big trade (currently \~250 pips in profit). Sorry for the long winded message, this is more for me than anything but if you have any thoughts, comments, or concerns please don't hesitate to let me know.",https://i.redd.it/3l7smtuow3ue1.png,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jwehdf/my_personal_best/,7,3,2025-04-11 01:38:59,peopleeater23,"Congratulations on this achievment! 

BUT, as i'm sure you know... a single trade does not matter... Sure, you made money.. but if you're losing it over the next few trades, it means nothing.

Please update us at the end of the year i really hope you're consistent at execution and at managing risk.

Forex,Progress towards Prop Firm Challenge,"So I've been trading awhile on my algo on Oanda live with my own money, which has been successful, but my boss (who also trades forex) suggested I do a prop firm challenge since if I can get funded, then I'll be able to make a higher return faster. I trade strictly by algo, but he trades manually, but I was able to create an indicator for him that helped with his strategy that got him funded this past week.

Me, I blew up 3 free demo accounts with the prop firm last week, just figuring out their broker's api plus the tariff nonsense. I'm happy to say that this week I've managed to stay profitable every single day without even going close to the DD limit after I made some adaptations to my risk management logic.

Anyway, I attached a pic of my equity curve you can see on the 100k demo account. If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer.

Some changes I made:

\* Dropped my nominal volume to $400.00 per position

\* Set my TP on entry based on the entry price (see if i can get a quick nab), wait 30s, then set TP based on DCA price

\* Block USDZAR, USDTHB from trading

\* Trust my algo, never prune winners or losers early

  
\*\*Disclaimer\*\*:

Not trying to sell an algo or advertise or anything, mostly just wanted to share my progress towards my goal of a funded account and to encourage people to not give up. Takes a lot of retooling to stay within prop firm rules while also staying realistically profitable! I feel proud with the progress I've had and I'll update you guys once I buy a challenge.",https://i.redd.it/w4xqtb81ayte1.png,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jvrcng/progress_towards_prop_firm_challenge/,4,19,2025-04-10 06:29:32,Fold-Plastic,"It appears this thread is about Prop Firms and Scouting Programs.

I find this incredibly neat upward trend highly unbelievable.

can't edit the op for some reason, but rereading the sub rules I'll give a little more detail.

should be obvious but this is a scalping algo trading 15 usd pairs on the 10 min. $400 nominal volume per entry, TP 0.02%. normally fills a smidge over the tp price and $3-4 per win after fees.

I don't have numbers on trades per day but it's something like 50-100.

How is the risk managed?

First of all congratulations bro u are in top 5 percent and second of all tell me the setup😭

What's unbelievable? I pulled it right from the prop firm dashboard? It reflects realized balance.

edit: here's the current chart [https://ibb.co/MDWgtw3w](https://ibb.co/MDWgtw3w)

Both by the specific take profit target and the opportunity entries are given to cash out immediately rather than DCA only.

that's very kind of you. there's still more work I need to do to take only the best entry prices and tighten up my drawdown (not reflected in chart, chart is just **realized** pnl, I hold until I win so it looks great). as for this particular strat, it's literally just a simple indicator from tradingview that I slapped on alerts when it hits key zones. imo, my secret sauce is the risk management more than the strat.

Unbelievable in that a chart like that with a linear result looks made up. If it’s not, then it’s just unbelievably good. What do the rest of the dashboard results look like.

Forex,I caught this masterpiece entry on Gold. 1.5% return.,"Reasoning: Gold has been extremely bullish these past few months. Every time it settles on a new All Time High it has a slight pattern of retracing into a weekly FVG b4 reversing back upward and making a new All Time High. Price was overall bullish on the weekly but was retracing and with a simple look at the chart I already had a damn good idea where price wanted to go which was the most recent weekly FVG and also the only FVG within that bullish extension, so I wanted to enter in there. I watched as price slowly targetted the weekly FVG and the asian session eventually tapped into it, but I still waited. Off the power of 3 rule I naturally assumed that another session(presumably the new york session) would sweep back the old asian session low and give me deeper contact in the weekly FVG. I waited to the next day and the New York session gave me exactly just that. I entered off a 15 minute break of structure and targetted previous session highs. I set my stop below the weekly FVG and my Take profit at a past London high. I risked 1.5% to gain 1.5% roughly. I then waited around a day and half for my Take profit to get hit. I basically betted that I was catching Gold in its rebalancing/pullback act. All on demo btw to be clear. Just experimenting.",https://i.redd.it/3x4w6usjxste1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jv4hv9/i_caught_this_masterpiece_entry_on_gold_15_return/,18,1,2025-04-09 12:25:11,Hour_Ant323,Genuinly could have held this position from anywhere to a few weeks to a few months as long as Gold kept rising.
Forex,OB Strategy can't be a main one?,"Hi guys, I am still relatively new to trading I guess, so please forgive me for any mistakes here and there. 

Starting off with the topic then:   
My main strategy for entering any position is through Order Block zones, I draw them only when I consider them valid i.e. BOS, Inefficiency/FVG, (I still need to incorporate Breaker Blocks, but for now normal OB are fine).  


Entries are variable but for the sake of this post let's say as soon as price hits OB, enter trade, with SL a few pips above OB, TP is 3R/4R depending on the market. 

I do not expect this to be a bullet proof strategy but there are times where market will not respect these key zones over and over again, making it an absolute bloodbath. 

  
What other confluence should I consider? or should I just ditch this completely?

  
Image: 

90% of the OB are on the 5 minutes time frame with 1/2 on the 15 minute. 

the **RED** indicate failed OB.

the **GREEN** indicate respected OB.

the **GREY** indicate price did not tap in the zone. 

the **Purple**, ignore it.

A very colourful one, but nonetheless. If you get half those words out of your vocabulary you will do better. The idea of understanding where people have set their stops/orders is not bad, this FVG and all those other made up terms are meaningless. individual candles have no meaning, since their appearance would completely change if they were offset by 50%, while the price movement would be exactly the same.

A strategy can only ""work"" once you apply money management rules. Otherwise you're just doing a bunch of nothing. Gambling perhaps.

So your saying price action is bullshit?

Single candle stuff, yes

Ahaa so how do you trade?

Just look at the chart. Not that tiny stuff represented by a single candle, the FVG etc. that’s just down to the randomness of where a candle happened to open and close during the continuous movement of the price.

That's real, but i mean like what do u look at, what's your POI?

Everyone has their own. For me it’s about breakouts. Which is why current environment is so good. And it’s more important what you do after entering than before."

Forex,OANDA vs IBKR,Why is OANDA more popular then IBKR when it comes to forex trading?

I think it's the marketing? Oanda comes off as a more well known brand and something you'd see often (tradingview, etc.) so it attracts beginners.

Yea I’d say that’s a huge selling point if you’re on really short duration trades. If you’re a swinger than a few pips aren’t gunna kill the move.

both suck for leverage-CFD, unless you are from the USA

true, but 2 pips draw down from the get go on multiple lots vs basically 0 drawdown is still a difference :)"

Don't 'eid mubarak' anyone.

I like this setup. Break the high low , then wait for a lower low. If that happens, we’ve got ourselves a nice bullish opportunity.

Don't tell the OP what to do 🤣

Buddy, you have no data to suggest it will go higher than 3085. You can only be confident with zone setups like these that price will return to a level it has reached before. You setting some arbitrary R:R level assumes you know how the market will play out, which you can’t. Your SL is way too tight, too. What if it closes above your zone for a few candles then briefly dips below SL? Trading gold that would be a big L. If I were you, unless I have real data showing me otherwise, I’d set TP to 3085 and get rid of your SL (if you’re even using one)

Most of the time brokers take an Admin fee instead of swaps (interest) on Islamic accounts. But that admin fee tends to be very similar in price price to swaps (from what I’ve seen) 😂

Brokers don’t care, they’re in the business of maximising profits not helping people adhere to their religions. Sadly"

Edit: I don’t use Reddit on PC so I can’t post the chart. Nice liquidity grab. Most of the time price would go down to OPs level, but this time it reacted from that level. You can see how the first spike up consumed opposing orders.

Actually this is because... 

The price usually react from the first OB before the (BOS) ...
 I MEAN 
( Bottom of last invalsive wave , which made tha BOS )

In addition you also have FVG in this zoon ..
So the price mostly will react from this area

H4 FVG

Either a breakout or fakeout works, but in either case, always, always wait for confirmation of at least one bounce. But yeah, good observation. PA works like a bouncy ball around SR lines.

Why would you place a buy-stop above the resistance when trading fake outs? 🤔

Agreed. I’ll leave it alone.

The futures market has the same order types as the spot market.

Mind sharing your confirmation?

Thanks for the insight.

Check what the previous daily candle did and what the current 4 hour candle is doing, both should be moving in the same direction, this will be your bias. Wait for price to close outside of the range in the opposite direction then wait for 2 consecutive strong candles closing back in the range. Enter on the break of the high/low of the 2nd candle.

Forex,Confused about Prop Firm profitability,"Hey guys, been researching Forex for a few months. Primarily understanding price action, general market analysis, and have been using TradingView's basic plan to perform basic backtesting. I also have a background in mathematics so I'm not confused by ideas that arise from risk management and long term profitability.


I have been planning out how to foray into starting trading, but prop firms seem to be utterly impossible to make work? I've only deep dived on Oanda, so I will be referencing their structure.


Let me run through an example. A trader buys a challenge, where they are provided a virtual account with $100,000 for $599. 10% max dynamic drawdown and 5% dynamic daily drawdown. Phase 1 needs 8% profit. Phase 2 needs 5% profit. Total of 13% profit. 


To adhere with risk management, their real account size is effectively $10,000 (drawdown). To ensure natural variance doesn't kick their ass, 1% risked for each trade is a solid idea, therefore, $100 risked. By itself, that's awesome. If the trader could take immediate profits that is an easy $599 -> $10,000. From here on, I reference the eventual funded account as being $10,000, as that is the $$ available to the trader.


Now how can a trader actually become funded? 


If we take an example edge, let's say 1:2 risk:return, with a 40% winrate, the traders expected value is (0.40x0.02-0.60x0.01) = 0.002. i.e. over a large sample size they will make a return of 0.2% of their max drawdown each trade. That's $20EV for a goal of $13,000 before being able to take profit. It should be noted that a 40% accuracy is pretty god damn high when the true breakeven is 33.3%



This is utterly ludicrous haha. Sure, I think once you become funded and can make a withdrawal of minimum $200, that's a reasonable way to start (for $599 too!). But it would take a risk-conscious trader $13,000/$20 = 650 trades to become funded.


I have other ideas, such as implementing a higher risk:reward for the short-term. I wrote a python script which simulated the results of and it seemed possible that you could up the risk:reward to something like 10% of max drawdown to 20% of max drawdown, but I didn't have time to get very far into my analysis. Off the top of my head you could get 30% - 60% of your attempts funded with various scales of accuracy and risk:reward of max drawdown.


Further than that, let's say you do your best and keep trying. Even if a riskier strategy provides a 50% chance to fund an account, it's not unreasonable for you to fail 3+ times at those odds. Every fail is $599. $599 of your eventual $10,000 account is 5.9%. That's approximately two to six months of trading (given a reasonable expectation of around 1% - 5% return per month).


Can someone provide insights into what I am currently considering? 


Feel free to disagree with my math as well, I'd love feedback on it.

[**A detailed overview and comparison of popular forex prop firms can be found here.**](https://volatility.red/Trader_Scouting_and_Prop_Firms_Overview_and_Comparison)      


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Forex) if you have any questions or concerns.*

The equation I use to determine prop firm risk per trade is max drawdown / my max losing streak across x data… and then I reduce it a bit. In this case if a trader doesn’t often see a 10R drawdown in their trading then it is worth them risking 1% on a prop account. The ROI can be huge!

Of course if you often lose 20R (would be crazy imo) then you can risk 0.5% and still get a very good ROI.

It’s not a personal account and it doesn’t cost the same as a personal account which has the same buying power in the market would, so there’s no reason to risk only 1% of the max drawdown.

A simple look at your trading strategy data over a year would tell you all you need to know in order to optimise your prop firm risk management for max ROI.

You need $62.5 a day with 100K account to get funded in 1 year. That’s 2 x Nas100 scalps a day with like 2.5 lots targetting 15 points or one trade with 5 lots. That can be made at NY open with a little bit of daily prayers easily.

Forex,How many of you are algo traders?,"I've been algo trading stocks and crypto for a few years, and while I've traded forex before, it's only been the last few months I've really focused on forex specifically because of the leverage and because my boss is really into it though he hand trades, doesn't use algos.

I have to admit this has been working gangbusters for me though! trading 16 pairs fully auto and just making little tweaks here and there to inch up my daily return. I honestly feel like this market is way better than stocks and crypto.

My technical set up is tv webhooks to a python server to Oanda, and I livechart all my results in Google sheets also automatically which is fun to watch while I work at my desk.

I'm curious how many of you are also deploying algos? and what's your technical set up look like?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j18vco/how_many_of_you_are_algo_traders/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j18vco/how_many_of_you_are_algo_traders/,5,12,2025-03-01 20:25:22,tat_tvam_asshole,"Look into r/algotrading . I do both live trading and algo trading at low volumes whilst I test my strategy and finesse the code. I too have a TV pinescript API call setup into fxcm, but plan to upgrade this to a more sophisticated ML python solution through Visual studio code and API connections with brokers. I've been working on my master strategy for a couple years now and am pretty happy with it, barring some tweaks needed to risk management side. And also in midst of changing brokers as I've qualified for a pro level account with 1000:1 leverage and super tight spreads with IC Markets.

U can also use the Python bridge in mt5. I did work on pattern recognition (it would look at certain formation of swing low/high patterns and other indicators) hooked up to  mongodb and it was mildly successful. The biggest drawback of algo trading is making it understand the' change in regime'. The work that we did encompassed creating entirely different modules in signal generation, risk management, order management, portfolio risk management etc. Risk was a big part of it. Project is on hold for now, we are looking to take up on it once this learning model expert comes on board.

Ps oanda didn't provide any tick data, they have a limit on how many API calls u can make on their restful API.

Have you tried writing the code only by ChatGPT? I found for my strategy it somehow cannot debug its own code (python).

I completely understand you, I was into coding algos for futures but that was a mess of its own. 

Like someone else here said, creating algos ironically has became my trading income alongside trading itself. 
I’ve tried to deploy with python but I now heavily rely on mql4 and mql5 strictly. I’ve learned to transfer code between the two.

Currently running 3 pairs,

•Gold
•GbpJpy
•Eurusd

Averaging about 0.28% daily.

Regime change isn't difficult to detect/code, ime. I just use Oanda as a broker, not for data, and I trade 30min candles so API limit isn't a huge deal breaker anyway.

Are you looking into ML for parameter optimization, price prediction, or entry/exit prediction? I have a bit of experience in this area.

Oanda does actually provide tick data via their web socket connection, or FIX API.

That's highly dependent on the system of packages you choose (whether or not you can create/recreate a strategy). I'm almost certain though that whatever errors you're encountering are debugable by an AI. It may more likely be an issue of how you're prompting it. The heaviest stuff we do for data manipulation and TA is fairly entry level python stuff handled by pandas, numpy, and ta-lib.

Shoot me a DM.
I can take a look at it. ChatG really isn’t the best in coding, even o3-mini high isnt that good.

Oanda tick prices is stp prices, spreads are too high and FIX is reserved for high networth client and i would never open a brokerage account in oanda. However I like their mobile app. Dukas copy is another option but fix is reserved for high networth client.

They gave me access with acees with a $5000 account. I also find oanda's finance rates to be acceptable for long term trades to make up for the, tbh not drastic spread. 

I also don't know what you mean by stp"

Not sure if 4.5k is a lot of money to you or not, but if it is, I would look at what I’m risking per trade. Personally never risk more than 1% of trading account, an on funded accounts I risk 0.25 % - 0.5% per trade. 

Also if you see massive swings in your performance, that’s probably because of luck. A slow, steady curve will mostly indicate good practice. Good luck mate.

If you have to ask this then no you are not doing it right… forex isn’t supposed to be wild gambling, you make a trade once per day when you are 100% sure of your set up and your stop loss and take profit decides if you were correct or not

Additionally you have 8 losses and only 3 wins, each trade is its own set up so I’d assume that’s over 2 weeks (if it’s not you need to readdress  
your trading plan) also at the very least you are not winning 50% of your trades and that means your entry timing or chart pattern reading is wrong"

I got to be honest starting off with a funded was not a good idea since you just started learning you need practice and time to learn how the forex market works so for now I advice you to switch to paper trading and try to be profitable for 3 months straight before using real funds so you can go in with a strategy that works out for you and a somewhat decent mental though I can’t say if you will have a strong mental game or not that’s on you.

Forex,(Help) mobile trading with Oanda,"So I’ve put a little money in an Oanda account. I tried a couple of small trades just to see how operating MT4 was with a live account. Let me tell you!

I was able to close them all out in a different order than they were placed. Which forced me to realize losses on some of the trades. 
Then out of frustration with that, I linked to TradingView to try that, all seemed fine aside from the fact that I couldn’t trade a typical lot size, it wanted my total quantity! WTH!

Forex,Advice on currency pairs for SMC,"Hi everyone, I'm new to FX trading and using a paper money account to develop some strategies. I'm studying these so called ""Smart Money Concepts"" of looking at market structure, liquidity, and order blocks to try to follow institutional moves (largely based on concepts from YouTubers Photon Trading / Matt Donlevey and Fortune Talks). I began by watching Jason Graystone's content but was constantly getting stopped out, so I found these liquidity concepts interesting.

  
Anyway, I'm having a hard time identifying which currency pairs to trade. USD-based pairs have the highest volume, but they're all obviously tied to the performance of USD. So, I believe there's a huge correlation risk if just trading the USD pairs. Some of the pairs (NZD/CHF) are extremely low volume and have quite choppy price action. I mostly use 1D as my higher timeframe and 1H as my trading timeframe, sometimes looking at 15min for confirmation. 5min has burned me too many times so far.

  
What advice do you all have about selecting which currency pairs to monitor and trade? All of the major currency pairs is too overwhelming for me. I have a hard time assessing the true trading volume; Google indicates EUR/USD is the highest volume pair, but I rarely see it having the highest volume displayed in TradingView (Oanda is my broker).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1itsokb/advice_on_currency_pairs_for_smc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1itsokb/advice_on_currency_pairs_for_smc/,2,3,2025-02-20 07:08:43,Expwy,"Forex is a decentralized market, there’s no way to know the true volume information like you can with stocks or futures. I wouldn’t rely on any strategy that involves volume for Forex due to this.

Also, you do you, but personally I recommend staying away from SMC stuff. It’s overly-complicated and for no added benefit, is also based on a lot of overly-simplistic incorrect assumptions about how markets work, and is often created and peddled by scammers and fraudsters. 

Price action & market structure are IMO the best place to start as a trader. Tradeciety is a good resource for that type of stuff, but there are plenty of other sources out there.

If you’re day trading then just pick a few pairs that aren’t too correlated. Perhaps EURUSD and GBPJPY, or something like that. You can honestly even get away with only one pair as a day trader. 

If you’re swing trading, then you’ll probably want at least 3 pairs, if not more, to monitor since setups will be less frequent.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply. It's interesting what you say about SMC. I started to explore it as a response to my stops getting blown out and then price going in the direction I was essentially trading anyway. Do you have experience with that, or advice on avoiding that scenario? Do you look at areas where there might be a lot of liquidity built up and place your stop losses beyond those, or do you ignore liquidity concepts entirely? I could just set wider stop losses too of course. I realize that at the end of the day it's all about establishing a firm set of rules that work for me.

  
And noted regarding the pairs, thanks for that. I've actually had good results with GBP/JPY over time. Right now I mostly swing trade as I still have a day job, although my goal is to eventually support myself by trading.

You’re welcome. Yeah it’s a common thing traders do in the beginning, feels like every trade singles you out personally just to take your stop and then take off. But that’s not what’s actually happening. 

I don’t use liquidity concepts, no. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/s/uhl86p09bH) awhile back regarding some things that can happen to inexperienced traders that can make it *feel* like the market is out to get them (when it’s not), and some possible basic solutions. You can take a look at that if you’d like. It’s essentially just being out-of-synch with the waves of the market."

First of all, most people choose brokers for a good trading environment & spreads, such as IG, ICmarket, Vantage

Secondly, most people use trading tools such as MT4/MT5/tradingview/ctrader which need to be linked to brokers, which provide charts that allow traders to clearly know the direction of the market.

Good luck g

Sniper entry is a good thing. wdym you are getting sniped?

What do you mean by “getting sniped so hard”?

See my post

You can even use the 1h time frame, just make sure you have a good SL.

Usually at the end of North America session the spread widen I think it's due to less liquidity. The spread usually doesn't get larger than 15 pips. When the Asian session opens a couple hours later the spread tightens back to normal.

Also I have only been trading for a few weeks so I can only tell you what I know based on what I've experienced with my broker. So I'm curious if it's the same with other brokers

I swing trade, walk me through your analysis.

Probably stop loss hunting by other market participants? At least that’s what I assume

When your entry or stop loss is triggered from very very far away. Like the chart does not even go there.

Basically, yes, in fact, brokers face the same market, the liquidity of good brokers, this situation will not last long, if you need good liquidity can pay attention to the trading session of the U.S. time, is more active status"

Bullish

You don't trade based on what you think. You trade based on what you see, and what you see is how the market plays out.   
  
It could be -   
  
1) uptrend because global yield is rising and JPY depreciates  
2) JPY appreciates because we are on a risk off environment. 

3) GBP depreciates because of growth concerns in the UK economy.

For me is bullish

It will go up 🤷🏼‍♂️

when i look at the daily, it is hitting a place historically that has a lot of action. It is very neutral in my eyes. it is looking like short but you never really know with big moves like this. sometimes it continues sometimes it corrects. If it was me and i wanted to go short, i would open with a smaller lot size and when a good trend is establish, i would add.

It is rejecting from a daily time frame doji supply, Also a good trend continuation quasimodo level, trend is bearish and market structure is bearish as price broke the last lower low and created another lower low on 4h Time frame.. when you take volume profile of the bearish leg then it aligns perfectly with the supply.. this is very high probable setup brother. I also trade supply and demand. Jpybasket is also moving up and currently took support from Daily demand..  
I can analyse more and get more confirmations but then they start to contradict each other...

Really depends on what your edge is

Brother u got liquidity grab

Well, since you just sold it for no apparent reason, sounds like you might be gambling…

AUDJPY’s been on a steady sell-off for a while now, take a look at the daily chart and see where the price is COMING FROM and how it reacted to that level. Then, check sentiment and fundamentals. What’s the long-term outlook? What’s the short-term play?

Looking at how price is reacting on the H4 and Daily, do you really think that tiny level on the hourly is going to hold up when you’re selling with no confirmation, no momentum slowing down, and no solid reasons to back it up? Probably not…

Sometimes is best to have a fix risk is best

Take partials next time bro

Against the trend should always be watching close to your target

Having a perfect RR ratio will always do more harm than good. Anyone saying otherwise is just lying and trying to sell you something. If you're trading swings then never, never, never have your TP be past a SR level. There are what I call weak and strong SR levels... nobody teaches this stuff though (because they don't stop to think) and I never really shared it online. But the fact remains...

It amazes me how many people that ""teach"" on YT don't stop to think about this. YouTubers just parrot info for clicks I swear. Anyway, you are literally trading swings here.... think about it.

Now technically, price rejected at a weak SR level since it was invalidated. So, if I were taking that trade then I would've had a partial close at the weak level and then move up my SL to break even. In this instance, you would've gotten 50% of your original goal that way.

Most people never teach this, but just because an SR level is invalidated and becomes ""weak"" (what I call it) doesn't mean it won't be retested. Don't take my word for it, go study previous PA and see for yourself.

So, the key takeaway here is better risk management and loss mitigation strategies.

1. If you're not watching the charts 24/7 and swing trading (not scalping) then consider a trailing stop or partial close. Use the partial close around ""weak"" SR levels that have been invalidated.
2. If using a partial close, move your SL to break even once it triggers.

You're welcome.

*P.S. Sorry for the rant. I'm just an angry old fart that's been doing this forever and tire of the nonsense you find online. Anyway, hope this helps.*

They could still use their Oanda's US registration to open a prop business in the USA.

For me, this deal takes FTMO reputation to a totally different level vs other prop firms! They are currently in a class of their own!!

I see, thanks.

Oanda announcement of the deal confirms that FTMO plans to maintain the OANDA group as a fully standalone business after completing the transaction (https://www.oanda.com/group/media-center/press-releases/cvc-agree-sale-of-oanda-to-ftmo/)

Ah okay, that does make sense.

This is interesting. I really hope FTMO can come into the US.

I wonder what are the benefits for retail traders here.

Interesting. I was imagining it would be the other way around if anything

Does this mean that the prop firm is also owned by ftmo?

You must be a predictor…. Never try to predict always react

If you want to be a profitable trader respect market trends and stop forcing your entries . There are so many pairs you can look at . Analyze all of them and pick your best . Wait for the entry to get close to your zone even if you have to wait days . Once it gets there you take action and make the best out of that pair . Forcing trades will never take you far . There’s nothing bearish about your analysis and the pair . Please review again so you don’t make rash decisions.

i went to google the usd/cad exchange rate and it showed it went to 1.47

US dollar will get stronger = usd/cad is a long trade for the time being.

USD will rally and CAD will tank

You got the direction wrong. Dollar will dominate CAD. This is a golden long opportunity. Also trend is the confluence.

Forex,Problems with insufficient margin,"I mostly trade GBP/USD on TradingView and I use Oanda as my broker, but often times when I try to risk 2-3% of my account, it doesn’t let me. I have a small account of around $500, and my trades only get approved if I risk around 1% of my account. Can someone explain to me what I’m missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1ifpfhf/problems_with_insufficient_margin/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1ifpfhf/problems_with_insufficient_margin/,4,5,2025-02-02 04:41:48,Astreum98,"Margin requirements come from two things:

(1) the leverage of the pair

(2) the size of your trade (in units/lots)

For (1), GBPUSD’s leverage is 20:1, one of the lowest leverages offered, meaning the margin requirements are higher for this pair.

For (2), the lower the timeframe you trade on, the less pips you’re typically risking. This means you need *more* size to get the same risk, which increases the margin requirements further.

So, there are a number of things you can do. You can either:

-be okay with risking less than you want

-add more money to your account to cover the margin required

-trade a different pair with a higher leverage, for example a 50:1 pair like EURUSD or USDCAD

-move up a timeframe or two (like if you’re trading on the 1min, try the 5min, etc) and/or widen your SL to risk more pips and thus reduce your trade size, lowering the margin required

1. there's nothing wrong with a small account balance. You just need to understand that returns, while using sustainable risk practices... won't be significant.
2. You need to learn how leverage works in the markets.

Your forex broker offers a leverage of (likely) 1:50 or 1:100...

Now when does that come in to play? when you're trading small stop loss values... 3..4..5 pips. Why? because to risk 1..2 or idk 3 % of your capital over 5 pips, that requires an unusually large LOT size for your account size...

while if you're risking the same % of capital but over 30pips, that size is MUCH smaller.

So if you're really going for opening ""large positions"" with tight stops, just go for a higher leverage account.. 1:500 or something close to that spectre will do.

Do i think you should? Deffinitely not.

probably you dont have enough leverage.

You can trade a little more with eurusd but those rules are good for you. Don’t really want to be risking so much

What you're missing is called Risk Management"

You have the right idea. Def drop the BBs. Focus on the daily, I love that you have the patience to see how the daily plays out to gain confidence. I do something similar. I wait for daily sentiment/momentum, and scale down to 1hr. What do you mean by can’t test anything?

I'm not seeing any direction out there on the daily charts, looks like I will wait after the Fridays data.

I'm more of a discretionary trader the idea behind these trades is avoiding this week altogether feels mixed all week but it's hard for me to find confidence bc I can't test anything my idea is to be a fundamental discretionary trader and I want to use daily chart only and fixed stop of 160 pips and large targets 700 800 1200 pips I'm planning to start live trading this year so I need all the feedback I can get.

I'm not sure I have anything to back test being discretionary. I want to flow with the market with my entries and using stop loss fixed at 160 and large tp. My edge would be risk reward my judgement and trading off data & currency strength weakness... That's all I have to work with. Longer term swing trading leaning closer to position trader.

Hahaha just because you think that Trumps victory will change how dollar and gold work will. Its basic fundamentals for gold that it is treated as a safe haven, so no matter who the president of USA will be Gold will always be inversely proportional to US dollar. And for non existent is just that is how market dynamic are. To understand proper inverse relation look at 1d and 4h charts .

Nothing to do with Trump my friend, just basic PA. Correlation attest with dxy-xau is barely there anymore, hasn’t been there since last year.

Mate it’s basic fundamentals, it’s not about an actual correlation. When the dollar is strong, gold is naturally weaker and the price of gold falls it’s not about an actual correlation it is just how the market is connected like gbpusd for example if the dollar is stronger then it falls because it’s about how many dollars is in a pound and if the pound is stronger then it rises.

Last time gold traded below 1044 is around 2010. You can't do even basic math, by claiming that you're halfway through your TP, which would be at 1900ish.

Draw liquidity zones from the daily/4hr/1hr/30/15min. In that order and then see which ones have confluence (match), then wait for price to get close or enter in those zones and look for a reversal candle, then set your tp to the nearest liquidity zone and sl below/above the liquidity zone you placed your trade.

Spot on… Highs and lows of a candlestick is impossible to decipher. They can be pushes thru something or sweeps. They can be the product of the same entity building a position in the opposite direction(inducing weak hand dropouts to build the original position bigger at a cheaper price). There’s so many variables in play when forming a candlestick. And who knows if you’re looking at the right one….? Or even just looking at one of the combinations of candlesticks…? One can only guess…

Tell us the right questions then

I didnt get you 😅

The higher the timeframe, the more impact it would have over the longer run. If you get weekly low/high, it may take 1-2 days to see the results, maybe one week, depends. If you take Daily low/high, you can probably see the reaction on 15mins and make your move. I would usually dive deeper on daily lows/highs and look for Change in State of Delivery and pretty much then decide"

Once a decade or so I’m wrong, but I think they mean that after a move downwards, price action is finding a channel to range in, and some fundamental driver, report, news, event, etc. is needed to push the expected movement further downward for a swing trade.  Just speculating.

I don’t think that’s what they meant…

I asked why because it’s really not that deep. Markets move in trends. It’s pretty simple to swing trade without much consideration for fundamentals. In fact it’s a lot easier to swing without caring about them than it is to day or scalp."

Never seen so much amateurism pretending to be knowledgeable in single chart and I’m not even talking about the counter trend bias.

Where is the fair value gap you're talking about?

The demand for gold has increased because people and governments can no longer rely on the USD as a safe haven (the US government has weaponised it with endless sanctions and debasing by printing too much of it). 

The value of gold is now back and with it being finite, its value will only go up over time!

Your technicals for a short of that magnitude is irrelevant. A multi month/year swing is driven by fundamentals not technicals!

How should I begin working up?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1hxhpva/getting_off_the_1_minute_chart/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1hxhpva/getting_off_the_1_minute_chart/,0,21,2025-01-09 17:12:33,Pipesandboners,"Might be quite the change, and obviously you can stick to day trading if it works better for you but you could also consider swing trading. 

I used to day trade the 5min chart, but a little over a year ago I transitioned to swing trading. I do my analysis on the daily and execute on the 4hr. Took some getting used to for sure, and I changed my strategy (not always required) to one better suited to passive trading. 

Now I do all my analysis and set alerts near my setups from my PC on the weekend. Once price hits an alert throughout the week, I’ll check it on my phone (from wherever I am). 

If I like it, I’ll set a pending order (limit or stop order depending on the situation) and so then if price truly reaches my setup, it’ll get me in automatically without me being on the chart. Then I’ll set alerts to let me know when the trade reaches certain points so I don’t have to keep checking it.

This makes it so that I only spend up to 2-3 hours total per *week* on trading related stuff, including weekend analysis and journaling (which takes the most time). And my schedule is very flexible. Before, I spent 2-3 hours per *day* on trading, and had to be actively on the chart at the same time everyday.

I was a similar way, I work 9-5 so it made trading really difficult without being by my phone/laptop all day to monitor. 

I would still trade in the Asian if that’s working for you, but look for setups on the 4h or 1h with the strategy you’re currently using and see how it works on a demo. Might need some tweaking for the higher time frame, just backtest and see what happens. 

That’s the same reason I learned to code and just wrote my strategies as an algo, so I don’t ever have to touch my laptop (which is nice 🤣). 

Good luck!

1. Making 1 or 2 traders per day is not going to align with your ""check once or twice"" idea... Just to enter that, you'll need to invest A LOT of screen time.  A setup is there, when it gets there.. Not when you want it to get there.

2. Living in california can be pretty expensive, no? So let's say one can consistently make 10-20 % gain per annum (realistic goals)....  you'd need what? 500k in capital at least, just to live a decent life, rigt? Just something to think about for the future

Google no nonsense forex. That strategy is exactly what you are describing. He has a you tube channel that goes over the strategy in extreme detail.

Aside from looking for new strategies/setups, one thing you might have difficulty in is how much you can risk. At higher timeframes, the possible drawdown is much higher than at lower timeframes. You will probably need to decrease your lot size significantly. On the flip side, you're also aiming for increased pip gains. Just to give an idea, it's like halving your lot size, but doubling your TP, works out to be about the same, but usually with swing trades you aim for a bit higher.

This means that, at least in the beginning, it's quite possible that one swing trade is earning you a bit over one of your current scalp trades. You will eventually aim for higher returns as you get a better feel for the market, so don't let this discourage you.

The other thing you should take into account are swap fees. These either work for you or against you, but they are definitely something you should be considerate of if your starting capital is small.

How did you do for the past 6 months? Was it a strategy issue (not profiting) or time issue (profiting but investing too much time) that made you want to switch?

In my opinion, the D1 and W1 are the best to make trades, and so swing trading.
Higher time frames have more information of and impact on the price.
Less is more.
Your will have more time for your self instead of looking at the charts for hours and hours, you will use limit orders what will give your more control of your risk management.
Day trading can be very stressful and it influences your successful trading capacity.
With higher frames you will make less trades per week or even days without any, but at the end of the day, the results don’t really depends on amount of trades but about your strategy win rate and R/R.
This is just my opinion, if you want too, give it a try.

This is what I'm trying to do. Have a demanding 9 to 5 so trading in the day is impossible.

I do something close to this, it actually brings peace

Can you clarify your first point, please? It seems a bit rambling and I’m not sure if you were trying to be condescending or helpful. Obviously a setup gets there when it gets there.  One or two is the maximum implied, not the minimum. If there’s no setup there’s no setup. What are you tring to tell me here?

As for number 2, again, what are you trying to tell me? That capital needs to compound over time? I could have told you that."

Sometimes you don’t need explanation, because these are markets with big players that move deliberately against what you think. In the long run fundamental is important but in the short run there can be big moves against expectation. Take what the market gives you don’t expect it has so move a particular way.

institutional positioning

Trading the news is inherently flawed because access to information is very limited whereas data that effects the market is almost unlimited.

the pmi rose, however, the euro is still doing far better than the us.

you should check both sides and weight in their profits/wellness index

maybe look at future ecnonomic events? news are peiced in before they are released. maybe there is a future event which may forecast strenght to EUR

While it did came out more than expected, the employment part of the ISM PMI was worse than expected (45.3 vs 48.1) The employment part is as just as important or even more important than prices and new orders parts (since The Fed has two mandates: Employment and inflation) When its mixed, the market can't really go in one direction and continue

Also the expectations for NFP have been released and are lower than before (150k vs 230k). So the market is going to price in that as soon as it comes out and that's why if it matches expectations the market doesn't move as much cause it's old news (and why surprises are the biggest market movers)."

I executed the same trade on both platforms and they both have the same take profit. So not seeing how this leverage works.

If they both show the same margin, then they both have the same leverage.

you so not automatically have 50:1 leverage. That is the maximum allowed.

Always good to enter.. More trades more experience5

No

I would wait more, 1st you got the directions, 2nd, any setup that favour your strategy. 3rd execute, let sl and tp be your friend.

No.

Also, when you ask these questions, you need to tell us your thought process and how it fits into your plan. If you don't have a thought process or plan... get one.

Here's some points to be aware of:

1. Don't overly rely on indicators. That  being said, even your MACD isn't signaling a bullish momentum.
2. You have way too many SR levels on the bottom there. An SR level is more like a zone and should be considered fuzzy. Getting that granular means you think you're predicting something you're not.
3. Always, always get confirmation. That recent price action should not be considered support unless you have at least 2 bounces where its respected. Time and time again I have seen price slow down a bit to keep on dropping.
4. Trend lines, whether on the chart or indicator, are very subjective. Never believe a trader who tells you that a trend line made a difference in their trading.

Depends on your plan but i still see plenty liquidity underneath if you look to your left and the reaction of price in the area you have marked up isn’t a strong enough reaction for me to enter a buy here. Id personally still be looking for sells as price is still very bearish. But again, depends on what your plan says and how you look at it. Everything is subjective in the market and price could very well skyrocket

Never is the right time. This timing doesn't exist. It is how much you are willing to lose or profit from your current position.

If you decide to open a trade for any reason you need to first understand how your sizing is against other market participants. You can't win all but risking is an odd even game. You can't expect to play and play again only to win.

Your game need to be in the management skills and risk compliant you need to accurately apply to specific instruments in specific events agenda of the current history where we at. 

Take BTC for instance, we are months after the halving now. 

Take gold, we have wars and shit going down the planet which every single one knows that implies big money is secured in safe haven investments as gold.

If you take this game as flipping coins, you need to reset your money management to that specific type of trader you are. If not, don't flip the coin

Yes i did take it but it never reached tp just very close to it. I ended up closing it manually

My advice - In MT4, [activate the ""show ask line""](https://i.imgur.com/81I2u48.png) during times of low liquidity or for pairs with higher spreads. It will give you a visual cue of the spread so you can widen your stop, as necessary.

If you're manually entering and swing trading (not scalping) you always want that SL to be at least 5-10 pips over the recent swing highs and swing lows. This way it'll cover most average spreads or even a spread with a tiny spike... for this exact reason.

If you're scalping, there's a couple different methods to go about it, but as a rule of thumb I'd use nothing less than 1.5 times a 14 period ATR for the stop. That's a generalization as there are scalping strategies that don't even use a stop.

\#i\_feel\_ya\_bro

dats why i started setting SL a few pips lower or higher

Increase the RR by an inch or lose the whole trade. I myself try to squeeze in a lot, but re-enter most of it because of such scenarios. There’s no other way, lose some RR or re-enter. Plus the spreads. Entry could have been better, but I get you.

One thing you can do is consider the spreads when placing a stop loss. If your SL is at 1.26200 put it at 1.2621 just 1 pip or more above the intended zone

I'm sure that must have sucked but this is actually a really good sign to me.

It shows that you can correctly identify when there will be volatility, your timing is just off or your stop size is off, but you executed a trade when there was a possibility for you to make money.

I trade GBPJPY mainly so can help here. 

First of all let’s talk about your area of entry. I trade mainly off supply and demand zones and liquidity using trend lines and daily highs and lows. You are entering off of a demand zone which is to the left but the concern is that there’s a long wick down to approximately 193.180. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the zone will fail but generally I don’t like for there to be a big wick down because there isn’t any exact zone as it’s already technically been swept.

So I would say your entry is okay but personally I haven’t taken a trade here as it doesn’t fit my plan right now. GBPJPY seems to be at a decision area where it could move up. But, It also is giving indications of moving down on the four hour. we’re in an uptrend recently since the beginning of December But we’ve had a strong four hour candle drop here which is this area we’re in now so I would be waiting to see what happens. I wouldn’t be taking a trade.

Now let’s talk about your trend lines. They’re not really drawn correctly. I can see the top one cuts off the wick. Generally you draw them on top of the wicks. That’s where all the liquidity is sitting. That’s what price is targeting that’s where people’s sell orders are sitting if you were taking this trade. A good area to target would be the previous daily candles high which is at 194.987 generally price is attracted to the previous daily candles higher or low whatever it’s closest to whatever zones are there to help make it happen.

My answer to your questions one two is no. But if they were yes to answer question four I would be placing my stop loss at the low just to be safe which would mean your risk reward is lower but generally with GBPJBY which I’ve been trading for years it does tend to retest the lowest areas sometimes multiple times before shooting in the direction you want to.

How long have you been trading for?

FYI, this was written with speech to text because I had so much to say so apologies if there’s some errors

Here are suggestions for the questions based on the provided chart and description:

1. Was it the right decision?
Taking a long position in an uptrend is generally a good decision, as you are trading in the direction of the trend. However, entering at a lower low might indicate a potential retracement or temporary weakness, so confirming the trend's continuation is crucial.

2. Was it the right point to enter?
The entry could have been improved. Entering at a lower low in an uptrend might not be ideal without confirmation of a bounce or reversal signal (e.g., bullish candlestick patterns, moving average support, or oversold RSI). Waiting for a higher low or breakout above resistance would have been safer.

3. What better could have been done? Or what would you have done?
Wait for Confirmation: Before entering, wait for clear confirmation that the trend is resuming. Look for bullish candlestick patterns (like a hammer or engulfing), or a breakout above a resistance zone.
Use Support/Trendline for Entry: Entering closer to the trendline support would improve risk-to-reward, as the stop loss could be tighter.
Assess Fundamentals: If fundamentals support an uptrend (e.g., positive news for GBP or weakness in JPY), it strengthens the decision.
Monitor Momentum Indicators: RSI or MACD divergence can confirm if the price is likely to reverse from a low point.

4. Your Opinion on TP (Take Profit) and SL (Stop Loss):
Take Profit (TP): A logical TP in an uptrend is near the previous high or just below the next major resistance level. On the chart, aiming for a level like 194.6 or slightly below would be appropriate.
Stop Loss (SL): The SL should be set just below the recent swing low or below the trendline to protect against unexpected breakdowns. Placing SL below 193.2 (the previous low) would provide a balance between risk and reward.

Additional Suggestions:
Always calculate the risk-to-reward ratio before entering a trade. A ratio of at least 1:2 is recommended.
Consider using a trailing stop loss to lock in profits if the trend continues upward.

Combine technical analysis with fundamentals to strengthen your confidence in the trade.

UPDATE :

Hit SL

It's hard to enter at this point, you should've waited to see any valid confluence

can u clarify which price level are you referring to as ""low"" ?

Thank you very much for a detailed and simple to understand explanation. 🙏🙏

GBP tanked due to news. Check forexfactory.com news calendar

No worries! Happy to help.

The indication is that we’ve had a large sell candle. Can’t really give you any sources just is how it is. If you see a large sell candle on the four hour and price is struggling to push up like it is now, that’s the indication. 

But we haven’t made a lower low yet, so I would still mark GJ as more likely to push up than push down. But once again like I said, we’re in a decision area where there’s no clear next step for GJ. Until I start seeing it push up and break the next high (195.004) then I can confirm it’s going to continue moving up and look for some demand zones to take longs.

The “low” on your chart is the lowest point in that area where your trade is (192.930). Obviously it’s up to your plan ect to decide where to put your SL, but that’s where I would be putting mine as like I said GJ likes to retest zones. 

If price does push up a fair amount id move it to where yours is, then if it continues, set it to break even (although he been making the mistake of setting it to break even too early lately).

In about an hour volume will start picking up at London opens and New York afterwards so we’ll find out what happens then. Like I said my bet is that price will break the high, and whatever demand zone cause that breaks when price returns which it often does, I’ll take a long off that, given other boxes of my plan are ticked."

Usually after spike price will pullback and find some level to consolidate and bounce. I never took it as rocket launcher. I experienced many times enough that my SL were nudged by slight touch of shadow before they went straight to my target, so finding all those relevant level does matter. Proud? If you are not in desperation, profit or loss doesn't matter, every trader will always learn new things from their trade, so I would be proud knowing that I made profit, or I learn some valuable insights from the losses. Just watch money management closely.

Yes and no. It was a nice entry that went in your favor. But it was *one* trade. Unless this was a FOMO, risk the whole house, one-and-done trade, then it’s nothing to make a big deal about in the grand scheme. Consistency is the 🔑 

But enjoy it for today. Good work

U should not be proud or feel any strong emotion towards a particular trade.. a single trade is gamble , spread betting..
If u have an edge, u know over a series of trades you will be profitable. So most emotions r out of the equation,.. pride = self expectation = suffering

Buying at the top of a range before a breakout isn’t the smartest move. Why? Because most breakouts are fakeouts. Also, price often sweeps the bottom of the range first, taking out weak hands, before making a real move. 

If you’re looking to catch a move like this, the smarter play is to buy near the bottom of the range or wait for a sweep of the lows. Then go long once price shows a strong reentry back into the range.

I went long predicting that price would break out of the rectangle the same way it entered, but CAD news is what  pushed price that high.

As long as you followed your rules and strategy, yes, feel proud for a minute then forget about it. Don’t linger on wins or losses for too long.
If you didn’t follow your rules, no, don’t be proud of it. Journal it and don’t make the mistake again.

You can not follow your rules and get a winning trade, just like you can follow your rules and get a losing trade. But as long as you’re doing the same thing over and over, be proud of the consistency.

Win is a win and no one gets broke when taking profits. Maybe not the best entry reason but you made money and you should be proud of yourself.

Just the bad omen hit you than you can rethink of your pride

I’ve never used MT4 but it’s quite old and lacking in features from what I’ve seen.

To connect your Oanda account to TradingView, go to TradingView and then look at the bottom of the page when on the chart for a currency pair, there’s a tab called “Trading Panel”you can open. From there, find Oanda and click it, then login.

I recommend you tradingview

MT4 if you are planning to automate stuff.

MT5 is more powerful and performant than all of the above. 

Edit: since Oanda doesn't support MT5 (yet) I recommend Trading.com.

I use MT3 with Fusion markets as my broker. Id never use Oanda or an American based broker due to lack of leverage.

The leverage limit for US brokers is because they are actual Forex brokers and regulated. When you place a trade, you’re actually trading the Forex market. And there’s no chance your money may be stolen or that any shenanigans are going on.

Unregulated offshore brokers are not actually Forex brokers, they use sim accounts for their customers and when you want to withdraw money they have to give you money from the pool of money they’ve received from other customers. They attract customers with very high leverage and are able to offer that because the orders aren’t actually going to the market. Because there’s little to no regulation, they can literally just steal your money or manipulate your account, and there’s nothing you can do.

Did you try cTrader with Fusion Markets? That is another ball game"

Would've, could've, should've game doesn't help in any manner.

Place your stops where they make sense, not where they improve your reward-to-risk ratio. In this case, the stop should have been above the small consolidation and above the larger consolidation to the left, where you only marked the wicks. That larger zone represents the previous range, and a break above it would invalidate your setup entirely.

Always look left for similar consolidation areas within the same price range. These zones indicate levels of interest where accumulation or distribution occurred. Ignoring them or marking only the wicks is a mistake. If price breaks through, it signals a shift in control, and only then your setup becomes invalid.

Stops are too tight, a few more times and you will learn that trying to be a risk:reward queen isn’t going to get you anywhere in this game

Don't listen to people who say to stop watching the charts... always watch the charts even if you lose. It's how you learn.

That being said, your stop was too tight. Having a proper SL is more important than a risk reward ratio being perfect. I've made good money with a 2:1 RR, for instance. And a 1:1 can be profitable. So, don't buy the notion a perfect RR is the most important thing. It's not.

When setting your stop algorithmically, personally, I use the ATR for the last 14 bars times 1.5x or 2x. If I'm swing trading it's a 14 bar ATR on the daily. If I'm scalping it's a 14 bar ATR on the same chart I'm scalping.

If you're setting it manually while looking at the charts, then just accounting for the swings is good enough. But, you have remember SR zones need buffer and to account for recent swing highs and swing lows.

In this trade, if you look at the 26th and the 27th, you have two bounces respecting a support level (it's fuzzy, not concrete). Then price broke through it but came back to that level as a retest that became resistance and the retest failed. This is very, very common. Think of price movement like a bouncing ball between SR levels. The harder the ball is thrown the quicker it's gonna bounce back.

Anyway, it was a good trade man. You just had your stop too tight, that's all.

I’m very “conscious” and know for a fact I can actively feel myself doing FOMO and I over leverage. I honestly just want to restart on a clean slate. I’ve done both forex and binary and find that one is somewhat easier than the other but that one is also the most toxic. My goal at first was to rich but in all honesty I just don’t want to work anymore. So if I make enough to be able to pay for the year in one sitting I’m okay with that but we obviously want bigger and better. It’s not helping me or my family get out of our slumps/faults. Just turned 24 and no kids so I’m “young” but time is slipping as I can actively see that every hour essentially which can be nerve racking. If someone could help or steer me I’d be forever grateful.

Nice

Forex,"Oanda platform - Take profit target price hit, but the order is not closed","I have been trading with Oanda for more than 3 months now. I have been setting up take profit values and stop losses for my orders since I started. Today I noticed that the take profit price was hit but the order is still open. It happened today morning as well. Luckily I kept the app open at that time and I closed it manually. But for the order I placed after that I wasn’t home. When I came back and checked the app, I was at loss since the order was not closed when the take profit price was hit. Would like to know whether anyone else has faced similar problem with Oanda app? Any suggestions to fix this? I contacted the customer support but they aren’t even accepting the target price is hit. I have the screenshot proofs of the timeline.

How far did price go beyond TP? Share the screenshots here

do you have account manager? you can talk to your account manager too

Sorry I was on call with the Oanda Supervisor. He was explaining to me it’s because the ask price was not reached. I am not able to check the ask price on my app at the moment. So not sure whether the ask price was reached. I’ll check it later on my computer when I go home.

Thank you for your suggestion! I also thought about that. But started doing paper trading, to check whether it’s working or not. It’s okay until now. I didn’t have that problem if I set the take profit price instead of number of pips. If I face the same issue again I’ll contact the account manager."
Forex,Partials are your friend! It doesn’t always have to hit TP that’s toxic 😭,,https://i.redd.it/3zgenu50353e1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1gzyh3s/partials_are_your_friend_it_doesnt_always_have_to/,3,10,2024-11-26 00:19:42,SecretDay7877,"I think what’s more toxic is calling people who stick to their plan toxic.
Everybody’s plan is different, you do what works for you and I’ll do what works for me.

To God b the glory great things He has done, so much that He gave His own Sonnnnnnn!

If your plan is to ride a trade out hoping for a TP without seeing the already amassed profit that’s greedy especially when it comes to anything more than 20 pips. Just said it doesn’t ALWAYS have to hit tp, there’s logic in taking some profit out what the heck

Ur smoking something

amen, you shouldn't criticize people for sticking to their plan tho bro

My plan is to wait for hit to TP or trail my SL to the point where the trade would become invalid. 
I don’t go for 1:10, I go for LQ between 1:2 and 1:5.

If you think it’s greedy to just move your SL based on Price action, maybe it would be for you. BUT, it could also be argued that taking partials is greedy because you just want your money AND YOU WANT IT NOW! 

My point is, you can’t say something is toxic when your statement is also toxic. If your plan works for you, good, but don’t impose its standards on other people. If somebody doesn’t tweak their strategy to be conducive to maintaining their psychology, they will never be profitable. With the variable of people involved, there will never be a best system, and NOBODY can say that taking partials, moving. SL, or not changing anything is bad or toxic.

If only!

I’m not criticizing anyone, if anything it’s sound advice. If it runs through the TP after a partial is taken, GOOD. If not and reverses GOOD, what’s not good is setting TP at 40-70 pips and not taking partials along the way, that’s too much time for price to reverse especially with having a 10-20 pip stop loss. Price always hitting your tp is a trading ego boost"

Learn to create a buy/sell bias before executing with technical analysis. 

Fundamentals gives you the 'what' and technical analysis gives you the 'when'.

Why did you go against the trend?

it was a good try, it made sense to pullback, it just decided to just make a shallow pullback. part of trading losses

Mightve took out sell stops however you had no other confluences to take an entry, fvg? orderblocks? heck you dont even have those shitty little candle doji shits or whatever. Next time dont go off just one confluence have multiple. This trade was the equivalent to entering after a fake break out the trend lines. 

Everyone makes mistakes, go on 1m 5m 15m 1h 4h to check where you went wrong and then journal it so you can improve for next time.

May god bless your future trades

I already traded this buying side entered at 2694 on 15 min confirmation

booked at 2705

You should have confirmation on bigger TF

if you look at 15 it broke small range

and on bigger timeframe 2707 was major resistance

Gold was very strong from last 4-5 days it never broke previous low on 15 min or 1 hr

always avoid going against trend in this kind of price action

Buys all the way I guess. Wait for a pull back and go all in. Yolo.

My answer is fully technical: its creating higher high y higher lows. Definitely a uptrend. So you went against the trend. “Hoping” it will go down or retrace. You got to follow the trend. Better wait for a retracement or pull back to enter a BUY rather than a sell. If you want to sell Use basic technicals like trendlines. Once it breaks a trend line its the FIRST confirmation Of a reversal. (I dont trade “break of trendline”. Its the first confirmation !). After there is a break of trendline the second confirmation you will need to consider is atleast 2x lower low and lower high. Once that is established. Then the 3 conformation will be: Supply and Demand zones / FVG / Breaker block / Order block or support and resistance. Its all about patience and waiting the setup to come to you. With 2/3 confirmations your winning chance is huge. And not a guess or hope !

The fundamentals.

It is better to step off any asset when it is near ATH

I think market maker banks and institutional order block hedge funds haven't taken the few thousands dollars worth of sell stops yet. I think they need a few hundred billions worth of stops to takeout. Stop losses for now are still very low. Check with Blackrock to confirm this"

I'm currently showing 1.6

This is the pre-close spread, so why trade before the close?

First time?

Is right after 5pm NY time, it then goes back to normal. However keep in mind that if your stop by that time is less than 20 pips away you can get stopped out even when the price didn’t get remotely close to your stop loss.

It’s after the close. Well, if you’re not day trading, and you’re swing trading for example and price is 20 pips away, you think you’re still in the trade, well not anymore because they widened the spreads.

Every time after the US close at 5pm. At least in the cross pairs.

Okay I'll take a look. That's kind of in the lull between New York and Asia. 

I knew that on the weekends they go wide on their spreads but I didn't know in that time frame. I'm going to have to look for that.  I'm usually swing trading or position trading so I do have stuff left overnight and over weekend.

Spread widening and slippage do not affect orders already in existence. Unless it hits SL&TP.

Support and resistance are a scam

Which one can you please elaborate?

What works then?

1. Market Structure 
2. Demand/Supply(Order blocks - SMC fancy name) 
3. Imbalances (FVG - another SMC fancy name)
4. Liquidity ( Trend liquidity, EQL high/low liquidity)
5. Try not to use more indicators as they complicate trading even more(Just EMA's work well) 
6. Do your analysis place a limit order, never ever place market execution unless you're a scalper

You can trade with just 1 to 4.
And follow a system. There are a million ways to make money from the market. Just find one edge and repeat it over and over again. Never miss a single step of your system. Overtime you'll see traders just by glancing at the charts.

No SL is trading suicide. 

There's no guarantee price will fill the gap and even more so, there's no guarantee they will fill it by today or this week even. 

This week is filled with market uncertainty. And there's no telling how much more you'd lose if you don't close your trade asap

It will fill the gap, but only once it has met the proper support at higher time frame; In my opinion, this could go 50 pips before reversing to fill the gap.

What makes you so certain that price has to fill the gap?

Never think price has to do anything. Let it do whatever it wants and react to it rather than trying to predict.

If that was 9% of your account then you are over risking. Trade smaller position sizes otherwise you'll blow your account.

If it seems obvious, ur probably wrong lol. Whatever caused that gap has large volume and would keep it running for a while. Harris pol numbers increased and OPEC news over the weekend

No price is ever too high to buy or ever too low to sell

Gap was not filled bc it is seeking for another DOL. once it is met the gap will be filled. You cant just see a gap n be like oh its gonna fill. You need to let a whole structure happen with another gap in your bias. Now, you have a gap to gap strategy

News brother. You either commit to massive loss or commit massive gain out of it.

You can also join from nearest stop for either get straight up stopped out or straight up above.

It will normally be a liquidity sweep. Catch both nearby stop loss for sell and buy.

Can't take the risk, don't take the risk and stay away from news.

Close your position. Even with a loss, that loss would be small as compared when the market goes haywire when news comes.

I have traded short about 1h before the news and made my standard 1:1 trade successfully. Now you can see how weird can the market be, we all can won or loose sometimes. I am no longer looking for the bias anymore and those furu/guru youtube generic stuff. I mostly trade intraday, just looking what the market does now and where are the recent key levels. Most of the time work better then all that htf bias stuff etc…

Forex,"My take on EURUSD, opinions will be appreciated.","EURUSD has recently taken the lows of august and shifted its market structure towards the upside. On October 30th, we have seen the break of structure on the 4 hour towards the upside after grabbing liquidity at the 1.07782 level. My projection is that EURUSD will break structure and fill the imbalance on the daily chart then continue to go upwards towards to fill the gap at the  1.10830 and 1.1139 level. To further confirm my bullish bias, the market sentiment for EURUSD is 80% long to 20% shorts, as of October 30 2024.

scenario 1: EURUSD breaks the 1.08712 level, pulls back to the d1 breaker block and continues its trend towards the internal liquidity zone target. (MARKED RED ON THE CHART)

scenario 2  : EURUSD breaks the 1.08712 level. pulls back to the d1 imbalance, creates a lower time frame shift upwards and trends towards the internal liquidity zone target. (MARKED BLUE ON THE CHART)

\* as of publishing my analysis the imbalance has yet to form, (October 30,5pm PST)

\*\* news impact is not reflected on this analysis so trade at your own risk.

 Simple as that . Just use less lot size with big SL and you won’t believe how much your trading will change

H4

Centurily

Usually daily or 4H for POI and enter on 15m.

I swing trade on the daily. I use a couple of indicators and make my trading decisions around 4:30 EST, when the trading day is nearly complete. 

I don't always set stop losses since I've been spiked out a few times, however, I try to limit my losses to 2% of my account and most of my losses are less than 1%. If I don't have a stop loss set, I'll monitor it throughout the day.

I'll hold on to a trade until my system tells me to exit. It could be the next day, or it could be over a month. 

Paraphrasing a professional trader, trading is merely treading water until you can get a runner and make real money. I think I can do better than treading water, but my returns won't beat the S&P until I get a runner. You may only get a good runner a few times in a year.

I use daily and 4hr, then enter at 30m. I trail my stoploss and never put any tp to maximize whatever move the market is making. Thanks TraderNick.

All of em but Weekly and daily for directions . 4hr and hr for structure and entry

I enter on 30mins. Dk if that's considered swing trade?

I enter on the 4hr. Those are not “stop loss and entry snipes” at rollover, it’s called **spread widening**, and it happens at every broker around rollover.

H1 for entries. Daily and Weekly for targets."

No matter the outcome, I respect that you posted it beforehands. Everyone posting in here in hindsight is 101% fake or demo, so kudos to you.

It’s a buy

Hope your trade works out. Isn't it risky to have your stop loss where price was just a few hours ago? Isn't there a good chance price hits your sl for double top and then goes to your tp?

Hi liquidity

That's either hitting structure first then stop loss or Stop loss immediately

Spread must be tickling your sl😂

I think that’s a good thinking to go short at that point, but also I would have put the SL above the latest high, in case it will go to that point again.
and maybe aiming  for a closer tp point. Aiming for 1:1.5

I read through some of the comments... If you changed from sell to buy, your TP should be 153.750. There's a large 1H FVG pulling the price up to just beyond that point. Make sure your SL is below 151.100 as price will probably reverse down to 151.3 or 151.2, but then bounce to that 153.750 price around the middle to late next week.

Yeah, what AceMcNasty said.  Don't use ICT.  It's just overcomplicated mumbo jumbo made by an unprofitable retail trader who misuses industry terms.  Like, FVG isn't even a gap, it's just an arbitrary way to mark an impulsive move, but you shouldn't really even be trading in the impulse anyway.  ""Gap"" is a standard industry term with a strict definition, and FVG isn't that.

  
You do have the right idea of a top down approach though, so I like that.  Honestly, you could even use higher timeframes (though on gold, you probably don't need it right now since it's just been ripping on every tf, but it's a good habit to get into).  I start at monthly candles and work my way down even if I just end up scalping.  Just keep in mind timeframes are fractal, so everything that happens in 4 weekly candles, or \~20ish daily candles, or \~120ish 4h candles, etc. is all happening inside of one single monthly candle.  Starting at 4h is fine for intraday trading though, but I like to start higher just for more context.

  
All that being said, I'm not really sure what the trade was.  Long/short, entry price, stop loss, take profit?

Everything is a loss if you don't learn something

That's an awesome trade. I don't know why there are so many ICT bashers here. Maybe they are all just too stupid to learn the concepts and call them bullshit while trying to re-invent the wheel.

Myself and I'm sure others don't understand a few things you said there as the terms you used are not typical market terms but ICT terms. However,  you did higher timeframe analysis which is good regardless of strategy and you have multiple confluence also good regardless of strategy.

gotta say, AceMcNasty has to be one of the meanest traders on this app, but he's right. Everything about ICT is crap. Go foreign. if you're a beginner, expand your knowledge. You don't necessarily have to learn the famous setups, learning the underground ones can actually go a long way.

Ok thank you.

The leverage is the issue but how you place the order. I’m in Canada and their leverage options here are ridiculous. Hence why I trade offshore

The issue is mostly of money management because you're not supposed to actually bet the farm or get any close to it. Don't trade more than 15x.

My apologies for not clarifying properly. I meant say “insufficient margin”

I don’t know why I said liquidity

How exactly do you trade offshore? My Broker OANDA  is based in the U.S right now

I trade with PU Prime. Australian broker. Not sure if they work with US clients. You’ll have to check. They have some mixed reviews online because they aren’t heavily regulated. I’ve read of some people having withdrawing issues. Personally I haven’t had any issues with withdrawing money yet. My friend trades a 100k account with them, pulling around 4k per week from them with no issues also. With a 2k account you shouldn’t have any problems. Just double check if they work with US clients. I’m assuming they would since Canada is even more strict.

Forex,Available units calculator?,"I'm a relatively new trader and have been practicing with a demo account for a few months. Recently, I started trading with a small live account. One thing that's been a bit confusing for me is determining the **available units** when entering a position, especially for currency pairs where USD is not the base currency (e.g., AUD/JPY).

When trading pairs like **USDCAD**, everything makes sense because my account is in USD. However, when I trade non-USD base pairs like **AUDJPY**, things get confusing, especially when figuring out how many units I can trade.

I noticed that OANDA [used to have](https://web.archive.org/web/20230323053753/https://www1.oanda.com/forex-trading/analysis/currency-units-calculator) a tool that calculated the available units for you, but it’s no longer available. They had a formula like this:

`Margin Available * (margin ratio) / (BASE Currency / HOME Currency Exchange Rate)`

But this formula doesn't fully make sense to me anymore, especially when trying to apply it to non-USD pairs. Either my math is off, or my guess is they removed it because it wasn't really accurate or took certain things into account.

# My Questions:

1. **Are there any tools or calculators available today that can quickly determine the available units for a trade**, especially for non-USD base pairs like AUDJPY?
2. **Is this something that experienced traders just figure out intuitively over time**, or is it more critical to use tools like this when trading with a small account?
3. **How can I accurately calculate the number of units I can trade for pairs like AUDJPY**? I’m currently building some tools using code to consolidate a lot of data that typically requires going to multiple sites, but I want to make sure I’m using the right approach to calculate available units.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1fqzzdw/available_units_calculator/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1fqzzdw/available_units_calculator/,2,10,2024-09-27 22:32:39,altjxxx,"Position Sizer can calculate the maximum size based on your available margin if this is what you need.

If you trade through TradingView, the order ticket does these calculations automatically

If you are talking about position sizing, then there are a bunch of them on appstore. Just pick one that fits your eyes

I understand. In my case, I wasn't able to get into a trade because I didn't have enough margin available, which didn't make sense to me until I realized I had a different number of units available depending on the pair.

Do you use TradingView to place trades? Or something else?

TradingView. I'm unable to see how many units are available using it though, so I seen to have to bounce between OANDA and TradingView to get a better understanding around the units. yeah

There’s a margin meter at the bottom of the order ticket (at least on PC/laptop). I think it says “order info”. You may have to click it or drag it to expand it. Mine was hidden for awhile until I realized I could expand it again

Ah ok gotcha. Thanks for the tip!

If your model tells you to put your stop loss in that zone then it has more presence than any comment you read here. Treat you strategy like a scientific hypothesis where you have to observe (backtest, live trade in demo) to verify if your assertions are correct. Don’t trust anyone’s comments on your trading trust your method.

Your gonna get taken out

Please learn technical analysis n ditch trend lines🙏🏼

It looks like it is in a pullback zone. I would reiterate this trade.

It depends on your risk management. If you’re comfortable losing that much, it’s all good! Are you risking that much to gain how much? Price might take you out if pull back happens

What instrument is this? It's not optimal to assess a position with limited information.

I put a stop further away than a TP so its harder for my broker to travel as it takes less orders to retrace than to make new highs/lows.

Forex,It feels like 1:3 RR doesn't work for my positions,"First time poster, 6 month lurker. I'm on my second month trading very small amounts through Oanda. Down about $5 on a $40 account as I try to find my system.

One thought that keeps occurring to me is that a 1:3 rr simply doesn't fit the trades I tend to find and take. As you can see on my -$0.36 loss from this morning, I entered just a bit too early. But further, a stop loss just a bit wider would have been a safe bet.

I know scalping for such small amounts is a higher stress activity, but since Monday is my only day off and I can spend a good few hours looking for trades following the New York open, I feel it's where I should be putting in the practice.

SO MANY sources suggest that 1:3 is the be-all-end-all of RR, but I find that this almost always sets my SL too close, or my TP too far away. I would love to hear some more seasoned Forex traders' philosophies on SLs and TPs.

Also VERY open to useful critique! Just glad to be here, in a community where I've already learned so much.

Having a 1:3 rr is not about moving sl closer to entry to fit a 1:3, it’s about closing your trade or taking trades that give u a 1:3 rr without having to do anything. That doesn’t mean that you should change your strategy to just take 1:3 rr’s cause there’s people that make money with a 1:2 or even 1:1’s. You just gotta find what works better for your strategy

Maybe aim for 1:1.2 (your win rate must be at leat 50% for this) and then move the SL as BE once it’s over the 1:1.2 and let it run and move the SL higher when it’s possible. Just a suggestion.

Everybody already spoke on the 1:3 ratio, but I'm just gonna mention that, since you realize that you entered the trade too early, do you understand/see why? Figure that part out. 

I'm looking at your chart and it's clear to me in retrospect that you should've entered on the confirmation of the retest/failure , instead you preemptively entered on what you thought should happen. 

I don't have perfect entries either, instead, I usually have 2-3 entry orders setup and waiting. Say I'm going in with $100, let's use your trade for example. I'd have entered with $25 at 1.35031, then another order for $35 at 1.35050 and finally, last entry order for $40 at 1.35080. If all 3 hit, then your average is essentially 1.35057, you can then set your SL and TP at 1:3 if you really want that ratio, or like others have suggested aim for 1:2 to play it safer. 

 I'm using these numbers loosely based on your trade setup, but it's a tight fucking trade my bro. By having multiple entries, it can help offset the tightness and give you a little more legroom to find a better entry, and subsequently a looser SL. 

I usually set my SLs past a level that it's bound to retest (look at your 7:40am candle high), I'd have aimed above that. Move your short position box to 1.35057, your SL should be technically be at 1.35118 and TP at 1.34874. I simply used your numbers, and didn't try to make the chart hit TP, I just did a 1:3 ratio on what my ideal entry would've been had I followed my multiple entry approach. 

If anything's unclear, write back. I'm high off my weed pen and some pre-workout (about to hit the gym) so my reply might seem a little unclear lmao

Don’t just make every take profit 3:1 or 2:1 … it has to make sense on the chart… your take profit should be a significant level of support or resistance or a moving average preferably the 50 or the 200.. if you would have picked the low of the day from the day before you would have hit your target… each take profit needs to be tweaked to each situation.. use the charts not ratios only

Looks like you’re entering without using confirmation. This is a good way to get stopped out unnecessarily. It’s something that gives you a bit of evidence that what you’re expecting to happen is potentially starting to.

Could be something like a specific candlestick, candlestick pattern, trend line break, indicator signal, etc. Something that shows you that it’s actually starting to turn before getting in.

On this particular trade, a trend line break or break & retest of the pullback’s trend structure could’ve worked as entry confirmations for example.

Also, like others have pointed out, base your targets on the chart, not on fixed ratios. You can keep fixed ratios in mind, but don’t blindly use them as your target unless you have nothing else to go on for a particular setup.

Try using a 1:1 BE strategy, you only need %40 accuracy to be protiable at 1:3. 
Also, trading is not a ""part time thing"" or ""passive income"". It takes full time dedication to be successful.

You should also work on your entries, taking a short on such a big timeframe (4h) level is also a bad probability trade. Price was bound to reverse, you can see the bullish momentum growing at 15m too.

It’s kinda struggling at that resistance level - personally I would wait a bit for a strong bullish move higher.

ofcourse u go long, break of resistance and a pull back which is a retracement and a beginning of a impulsive move, plus the trend is making higher highs and higher lows, so now u go long and place ur SL under the last bullish candle on the 1D with TP on some old resistance/support or fvg u can find on the chart before

wait for the pull back

It's at resistance right now

For the daily which I dont like trading btw the signal line is running parallel with the MACD which I dont like however the next cross over would be a sell. The rsi is high which I like but its not over 70. If I was a betting man I would think this is a sell with a correction down to .675. not sure how long that would take though

After talking it over with a friend. He says 1 lot at take profit of .6800 with a stop loss at .68205

FX streets average puts it at 34% bullish 33% bearish and 33% sideways with a avg forecast of .6793 which is honestly horrible I wouldnt even touch this pair right now personally. 

When we open the market opens at 5 today were on sydneys market which moves about 65 pips a day

Also the hourly forecast signifies this is a sideways market. I really wouldnt touch it.

0.68700 (TP)

it’s wick pulled back on the 1D, so on the 4hr or 1hr ofcourse it confirmed the pullback

you got there using fibbonaci? I found similar results with RSI and MACD

just trail you stop loss based on market structure or key points

same here more or less but I got BE and then entered again close in profit

That fear is coz of quantity, lessen the quantity and try to ride your trade. Slowly increase your quantities. When you have less quantity you slowly develop the attitude like my trade will either be profit or I will take a SL and exit. Getting stuck somewhere in between is harmful for your trading career.

How much more would you have lost if you didn’t close it and it stopped you out compared to what you closed at this time? 
Was that potential savings worth missing the possibility that it turns around and hits the TP? 
Maybe sometimes it will be, maybe never. Guess that depends on you and what you’re doing, but I’d guess no.

I will work on it for sure.

Try to use a bigger SL. Because the brokers can do that. In fact, when you open an account with them, you agree they can do this.
The thing is that nobody reads the terms and conditions.

Forex,Can someone explain to me what I did wrong ,"Hi! I recently started trading and am currently taking a course on SMC (Smart Money Concepts). Today, I applied what I've learned so far by analyzing the charts and initially felt confident about a trade setup. I identified an imbalance in the market, marked it, and then scaled down to the 5-minute timeframe. There, I spotted what I believed to be a bearish engulfing candle, which I took as a signal for a supply zone. When the price touched that zone, I felt confident it would reverse and move down. However, it seems my analysis might have been off, or it was just one of those unpredictable market moves.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1fdsakp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1fdsakp/can_someone_explain_to_me_what_i_did_wrong/,4,14,2024-09-10 20:40:08,Waveysaiyan,"Well if you trade with demand and supply you should be patient and looking for confirmations and testing the zones before you make your trade. Moreover there was another one zone up wich price had a great chance to reach and break or respect but there are some confirmations about these zones wich you should learn first

there’s no confirmation (such as an engulfing candle) for you to get into the trade… wait for a bearish engulfing candle stick to get in other than that you can wait for price to get to the other supply zone you have above where you entered…

in addition to where you put your supply zone (second box) is not where the sharp/quick downtrend movement started….

I don’t see the bearish engulfing candle

No. XAUUSD, SPX500 and NAS100 are CFDs, which aren’t allowed in the US. If you want to trade gold and the indices in the US, you have to trade futures with a futures broker. Gold = MGC or GC, S&P = MES or ES, NAS = MNQ or NQ

 thanks for telling me do you know any futures brokers that are good cause the ones I seen require a monthly payment I tried ninja trader but they’re the same as the ones I come by

The monthly payment (if we’re talking about the same thing) is for the data feed, it’s required to trade futures. Futures are traded on a central exchange, and that exchange charges to get its data feed.

For brokers there’s Tradovate (now Ninja Trader), AMP Futures, Optimus Futures, etc.

Yes, leverage is generally set by each broker. Also for US citizens the max leverage is always 50:1.

You don't set it on the platform side. You set it by using the appropriate lot size for your trade. It's really not an issue.

This question has nothing to do with my trading or risk management. The prop firm that I want to trade for requires its traders to make a demo account with the broker of their choice with either 1:25 or 1:30 leverage to do the evaluation. And I cant seem to find a broker in the US that allows me to change my leverage."

Daytrading,Why do some Forex charts have gaps and some don't?,"Charts from FXCM and FOREX.COM don't have any gaps between candles for popular pairs besides the Friday - Monday market opening gap. 

Others like OANDA and CMC MARKETS have gaps throughout the chart. 

So far, I've only traded charts without gaps.

Why do they occur for some brokers and not for others?
Is there something I should be looking out for when trading charts with these gaps? Or is it the same? Anything I should be doing differently?

Help would be greatly appreciated 👋",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1k2sfyn/why_do_some_forex_charts_have_gaps_and_some_dont/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1k2sfyn/why_do_some_forex_charts_have_gaps_and_some_dont/,4,7,2025-04-19 09:28:45,ulsq,"Forex does not have a centralized market, so there is no standardized way of gathering trade data. This can lead to differences because some brokers choose to only show trades made on their platform while others gather data from external sources, etc.

For OANDA, it’s because it closes everyday between 16:59-17:05 EST, and when it’s closed there’s no data feed, which then resumes once it opens, but now has a gap if it moved in that time. On the Sunday open, OANDA opens at 17:05 as well, 5 mins after some other brokers do.

So technically every chart can be traded the same, no matter which broker you chose right?

If the chart is different, the trades are going to be different too. The difference might be minimal enough depending on how you trade, but it's never going to be 100% identical.

You have to choose which chart you're going to use and stick to that chart.

Right now I'm paper trading on TV. When I choose a broker, do I have to use the chart from the broker as well on TV?

For example FXCM broker live trading would make me go for the FXCM chart. 

I would assume yes because of the accurate broker prices displayed.

Yes. Keep it consistent. It will make your trade reviewing/replaying/management/everything easier too. 

I trade sometimes with different charts between TV and my broker. It depends on the strategy that I’m using, but I’m entering on a lower timeframe in most cases and so it matters. If you want to prioritize price action it definitely matters.

I'll stick to one for now. I switched back and forth between broker charts recently because I've had problems with the one that I've used most of the time. 

Thank you so much!"

Daytrading,Got my best career trade as of yet on Gold.,"Context: Gold has been extremely bullish these past few months. Every time it settles on a new All Time High it has a slight pattern of retracing into a weekly FVG b4 reversing back upward and making a new All Time High. Price was overall bullish on the weekly but was retracing and with a simple look at the chart I already had a damn good idea where price wanted to go which was the most recent weekly FVG and also the only FVG within that bullish extension, so I wanted to enter in there. I watched as price slowly targetted the weekly FVG and the asian session eventually tapped into it, but I still waited. Off the power of 3 rule I naturally assumed that another session(presumably the new york session) would sweep back the old asian session low and give me deeper contact in the weekly FVG. I waited to the next day and the New York session gave me exactly just that. I entered off a 15 minute break of structure and targetted previous session highs as my first TP. I set my stop below the weekly FVG and my first Take Profit at a past London high. I risked 1.5% to gain 1.5% roughly on first TP. I then waited around a day and half for my my first Take profit to get hit and the other TPs were hit subsequently after. I basically betted that I was catching Gold in its rebalancing/pullback act. All on demo btw to be clear. Just experimenting. Today price hit my last take profit which was the old all time high. Took around almost 3 days for all this to happen.

I bought a SPY put after it bounced off the high at open and passed below the open price at 9:57. I sold too early at 10:22. Still learning to be confident with winners. Tightened my stop too much too early.

Because 1 hr is when the volume rushes in . Around two hours after market opens price tends to settle downwards and consolidate because of people eating lunch etc , causing the drop

send me exact time and date of your trade. Also was it a day trade or swing

thats an impressive trade although a tends to correct aggressively as people start booking profits after news driven rally

your trades seem to be 1:5 RR and thats awesome but the dip at 5:00 am on your chart went for an OF to mitigate and it went up after, hiting 1:12 trade as per my analysis. Good trade btw

I provided my Social Security Number to them but for some reason it wasn't validated. I know that theyre regulated but is it safe to send a signed image of it to them ? Has it happened to anyone here before ?

Truthfully I am of no help in this scenario. Apologies. I’m a futures trader and have never used this broker. I would suggest trying a few things 1) call/email their customer service 2) try a different mode of validating your ID 3) sign up with a different broker.

That is, of course, if you’re not trustworthy of them enough to send a signed image of your SS card. Seems kind of Sus tbh

Yeah cause OANDA is a regulated broker but why would they need a picture of my SS card. I’ll look into more options thank you"

Daytrading,Need Help,"
Hey guys,

I’m super new to trading I actually started learning last week and demo trading this week (it’s been rough) but I’m slowly getting the hang of it.

Anyways, I wanted to post this to ask y’all who are more experienced about your insight and guide me to whatever I might have missed here. As you guys can see I was targeting a short based off a rejection with that huge bearish candle (although there were two green candles in that lower FVG - does that mean anything in terms of disrespecting the FVG?) And I thought it would go down. Well, it did, but not where I wanted it to.

You see, I already highlighted the second FVG that I had in mind and it rejected off of there. How would I have known about this and what could I have done different and what am I not seeing?

Why wouldn’t I have just put a buy order once it fully disrespected the first FVG?

Sorry if I’m asking too much. I really look forward to someone helping me out. Thank you guys sm. ￼",https://i.redd.it/eoy8gp1lnlle1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1iz68od/need_help/,3,29,2025-02-27 03:17:58,IllKindheartedness30,"Funny how all the new traders go to ICT when he blew up publicly multiple times in the robbins cup. Michael Huddleston has admitted he’s made more money from his “mentorship” than he ever did trading. You’ll figure it out one day

This is more just general advice:  come up with a repeatable system or strategy, find as many examples of that strategy playing out as you can, do the math on if it makes sense.  Looks like you were trying to sell a pullback in a downtrend, that's a good start.  Define a trend, then define a pullback, then figure out the math that makes this a winning strategy.  If fvg is the way you define it, good enough, just make sure you've tested this to the point you have reason to believe it works. 
 YouTube is good for generating ideas and learning when you know nothing, but to have any hope of success you need to test ideas enough to either prove them wrong or believe in them.  What you did in this trade MIGHT be  really good strategy, but I doubt anyone on this forum will see it how you do and or actually test it to the point of proving it one way or another.
After you backtest this 100+ times, you'll be a better trader, and will be one step closer to having a winning strategy.

Imo, you're forgetting basics:


1. Do not chase. 


The first FVG you entered at is too shallow of a pullback to actually be a pullback. You're chasing, and the reason you don't chase is precisely because it leaves you vulnerable to the real pullback if it comes.


Of course, sometimes it does run away from you, being an extremely powerful trend from a higher timeframe, but in general, know that it's a risk you're taking.


2. Why wouldn't you have just put a buy order when it fully disrespected the first FVG?


Because you're in a very obvious downtrend with clear lower lows and lower highs. Fully disrespecting the first FVG doesn't change the design at all, and it's still going to look like downtrend mode to everyone.

So did you take a ""loss"" on this trade?

Enter your trade with your risk/reward ideology in place and have a definitive stop out level

Don’t know if this is frowned upon but I’m new to trading as well (say new coming onto second year) and I’ve been learning a strategy made by a guy called Sebastien Dubois, he’s got a mentor company thing called FX Academy (was called FXCartel). He’s got some pretty decent videos on YouTube for free. Had loads more but recently deleted them because now think he was giving away too much good insight for free.

My advice is always check on news before placing a trade, news data is a lot and it’s always good to know when you should and should not place trades based on your time zone, and for strategies I would say observe your levels, you could call it areas of resistance etc, and consistency.

That FVG created by the large red candle will 100% be filled.  FVGs have a massive retest rate. Has enough accumulation occurred for a a distribution phase back to the FVG?  Very possible.

I didn’t even know who ICT was tbh lol I just watched a lot of videos and saw ppl swearing by this strategy. Wat do you suggest ?

Thanks man. I appreciate the advice, especially at a time where I feel lost cuz theres so many strats so many ways it gets confusing. Thx"

You don't do anything. It didn't meet your criteria so you didn't take it, job well done. There'll be countless moves like this that you're not part of because they don't meet your criteria. Don't give them a second thought.

Your job as a trader is to build a system that stacks the odds in your favor and then simply follow it, because you *know* it stacks the odds in your favor. 

Anything outside your tested system has completely unknown odds. Sometimes a trade won’t set up but will go the way you were looking to go. Just think of it as none of your concern, none of your business. All you care about are *your* setups.

So, don’t chase price simply because it went the way you wanted to go but didn’t give a setup. Choosing to chase it, I can pretty much guarantee, will net an overall loss over enough time.

It’s a success because 1. I didn’t gamble 2. I was right

Roll into the fetal position and cry

Let it go...don't chase...

Not be in the trade and wait for my setup with that criteria. If this is something that happens often, find the consistency and have separate entry criteria for another setup and start testing.

Well. You win some, lose some, and miss some trades.

Also JPY has been strengthen the past 2 weeks. Does not look like forming a bottom yet. Long term could be EURJPY and USDJPY more selling pressure.

The only difference I noticed from papertrading to using a live account is the ability to have my orders filled using limit orders. If I want to be sure I get in/out, I have to use market orders.

That’s normal spread. As others have stated, some brokers offer raw spread + fixed commissions, but I don’t think any do in the US that are regulated, but may be wrong. Do not trade with an offshore account to try to get raw spreads, that’s a bad idea. 

If you can’t find a regulated raw spread account, then simply move up a timeframe or two. For example, if you trade the 1min, trade the 5min instead. If you trade the 5min, trade the 15min instead. It will increase the number of pips in your SL, which means spread will be less of an issue. And you can lower your trade size a bit to keep the risk the same as what you’re doing now.

Lol get an account with lower spreads ez

You always got to take account of the spreads. If this happened 5 times in a row it is time to try something different lol. Also i recommend raw trading for you.

I think yt trading teachers have the same stigma as car salesmen or probably worse. Like charlatans. 

So ict gets lumped into this category by association

With that said, if the ict learning info is free on YouTube and people are learning from it and it’s working for them then I don’t see a problem with it. Enjoy and good luck!"

Daytrading,Scalping strategy for me (a completely new player),"So what I want to do is to trade with my full £4000 on the forex EUR/USD to get a profit of 1% or £40

All I want is £40 profit per day, I have just started yesterday learning about trading/scalping and I’m doing this for just a bit of money on the side

So far from what I understand, is that I need the forex to gain 10 pips and then sell, however if I lose 10 pips I should also sell to minimise loss.

I’m going to use OANDA as a broker and trading view to see the actual movement

I am planning to learn the basics and practicing this a lil bit. 

But what do you guys think of this? Do you have any recommendations? A specific time that is good for this type of trade? Or any advice, even if this is completely wrong, I would appreciate it

Dont get me wrong but before u go ahead and do this I think u should slow down and have a different approach. U barely starting and are just learning about trading/scalping and ur already aiming to do 1% a day, when in reality the main goal of any beginner should be to preserve capital and not lose any money or lose the least amount possible. I know ur not gonna follow this, but heres my advice, drop down all these expectations of X % per day, “trading for a bit of money on the side” and seriously start studying, learn either of the many types of trading strategies there are, Id go with price action but u can choose whatever fits ur personality and liking, and then practice practice and practice more, develop ur own system and ideas about executing trades and only then deposit a small amount, I would go as far as saying 10% of ur 4K£ and lose it over few times and once u start showing some positive returns over time u can go ahead and deposit the full amount and start making some decent profits, again I know this isnt gonna happen, but unless ur an enlightened rare case of human being ur most likely to lose all ur initial investment just like over 90% of traders do when starting. This is a marathon, not a sprint. GL

Never count the money before it's in your hand.

If you put pressure on yourself making x amount a day you will end up losing. Try to instead focus on one good trade a day.

>So what I want to do is to trade with my full £4000 on the forex EUR/USD to get a profit of 1% or £40 All I want is £40 profit per day

""All I want is a 1% return per day, which works out to just a measly 1100-3700% per year""

""So far from what I understand"". And thats it, you dont understand anything yet. Learn the skill first, then try to make money. Everybody had the same idea before. ""I just want to make 20$"" and then learned the hard way. Chances are very very high you will lose all of your 4000$. There is 10 pips of EURUSD trade multiple time of the day. I would highly recommend you to first Learn the basic, trade at least 1-2 months on a demo account before even considering putting 1$ of your hard earned money in a live account. There a plenty of good videos on youtube to learn trading its just a matter of how serious you are about this

So you want to Play in the pro League eithout any knowledge ?

Rest in Peace Money 

Look If you wanna be scalping you habe ti understand the Market, how ITS breathing how ITS Working 

And as far you understood These you can Go from Higher time frame to lower be BE prepare the lower you are going tge more difficult it will BE in the lower area do you mess with AI and Institutions 

If you really new, forget scalping 

First understand What the Market so
Second build of thus information a strategy 
Third If this strategy Working for longer than Go a bit down with time frame and Test ist further 

Until you are in the Low area

Trade minimum possible amount 1 nanocontract or whatever you have on your platform to ensure that you strategy works long term. If you profitable for a month - increase you position a bit. If you losing for a week - decrease your position and regroup.  
Have a trading diary. Put you trading reports here. What you did good. What you did wrong, What setups you miss, What setups you shouldn't have touched. e.t.c.  
The longer you trade the better you become, so your goal is not to lose your account in the first 3 years, which is usually the amount of time it takes people to become consistently profitable.

first just trying to follow the big fihes whos made 65 k in a day  1% is esy i think its just luck looking a lot video and stuffs like that

Pure price action but get rid of that target per day mindset. Dont limit urself to how much u can make a day and how much u can lose a day."

Daytrading,Looking for Advice on the Best Brokerage for Day Trading,"
Hi everyone, I’ve been studying day trading for about four months and have recently developed a strategy I’m testing. I’ve been using it for two weeks now and plan to test it for another two weeks to confirm its profitability.

I’m aiming to take the leap into real-money trading next month and need help choosing the best brokerage for day trading. My main priorities are:

	•	Low or no commissions
	•	Reliable and fast market orders
	•	A solid charting tool

Currently, I’m looking at Robinhood, Webull, and OANDA:

	•	Robinhood: Commission-free and has a new charting platform I like.
	•	Webull: Commission-free and compatible with TradingView.
	•	OANDA: Also commission-free and integrates with TradingView.

What do you all recommend? Are there other brokerages I should consider?

If you are just starting out, I highly recommend Webull. Super customizable to your strategy with indicators etc for charting.

If you are Looking for a more advanced charting set up thinkorswim is pretty tight. Best of luck!

Going by your first criteria, RobTheHood is your best bet.

Are you from the United States? I noticed you listed a lot of brokers from the US. If so then I'm afraid I cannot recommend you much as many of them are outside of the US.

Also, judging by your username I assume you use a Trading bot, if so, how has it been going for you, do you have any past coding experience or could I use chat GPT to write code for a bot, and would you recommend automated trading over manual trading?

Thanks for the advice! My goal is to slowly build enough capital to be able to do this as my main source of income. Would you recommend trading from a ROTH IRA right off the bat to reduce taxes or use a regular account to start?

Yeah,California

My algos receive realtime news and stock market data and can be trading hundreds of tickers per day.  I couldn’t possibly beat my algos manually trading.

So many thing Can go wrong , power outage , network failure, flash crash , freeze on broker side , fucked up mentality taking over "" it will reverse , it will reverse "".

Just use a safety stop loss if you like to close yourself , or use a daily losses limits on broker side with auto liquidation.

I'm not saying you are a shit trader because it's nonsense, every body is a shit trader until he becomes a good trader.
However looking at the first picture, to me it's a bad entry. 

I dont know what candle you see but it's bullish in the zone and you are shorting at the unformed downtrend pattern, this may end up badly. This is easily going up again. 

You may be making a mistake that you want to catch the downtrend early, but the best trader don't catch the top, he looks for the downtrend and hang onto the wave.

Finally, not using a stoploss is a rookie mistake, if you think you can ""mentally"" stop the trade, you're gonna have a bad time...

Good trading is not gambling. Don't listen to him. But you can always improve your odds and your strategy by working on your setups so just keep at it.

Everything in trading is gambling - no one knows where the price will move next - but it's also a probability game - you choose and stick to a strategy that is consistently profitable.

Don’t listen to your friend. That’s your first mistake. As a trader it is you against the market. No one else matters unless they are helping you. Trade a strategy that makes more profit than it loses. That’s all that matters and you can’t really accurately find that out with an alt like jasmy because you don’t have historical data. Backtesting with crypto is not going to be easy unless it’s a major like btc or eth for this reason also. I wouldn’t be trading jasmy like that. Don’t be too technical based and short term. 

Look into the alt cycle and relative strength. When BTC pumps, capital will rotate to alts. Figure out which alts had relative strength to BTC and target those when you think the local bottom is in. Watch videos from Charlie BTC on YouTube is my biggest piece of advice here. Using what he calls spaghetti charts, you judge when BTC is peaking and then which of the strongest alts will follow suit as people take profits and rotate capital to alts. 

The flow goes something like this BTC > major alts (eth, sol, XRP, etc) > minor alts > meme coins > shitcoins. Then a big flush of liquidity and leverage, BTC corrects to the downside then eventually at some point the cycle begins again, assuming we are still in a bull market. 

When BTC moves 5% the alts will move bigger. So get out before the market turns on your alt bets. Telegram is invaluable. Look for alert pages like binance liquidation alerts, Bybit liquidations, trade copier TG groups (don’t copy but use them to judge what the big boys are doing). 

Avoid trading shitcoins at all costs and the less capital you have the more you should probably avoid trading crypto altogether and look at forex/futures. 

You can do very well in a bull by using whatever capital you can afford to lose comfortably, dividing it by 10 or whatever number and make a bet on 10 meme coins to hold for months until the market top is in (Coinbase being in the top 10 of the iOS store could be a top signal, or your non tech, non crypto friends asking about if they should invest in the frog coin, or your grandma suddenly asking if you know about crypto.) Just hold those meme coins to the end of bullish momentum and sell at a pre determined top signal. Do NOT just pick a very obvious arbitrary number, but maybe 3/4 of the way to one of those price levels, pull your initial investment and DO NOT fomo back in, DO NOT marry your bags. Be fickle, fast and dump all that shit. You can leave runner bags but be completely prepared for them to vaporize in an instant because more than likely they will once the market has reached a certain point. 

Good luckZ

Umm what is your strategy here?

Not saying you're a shit trader for this set up but definitely could do with perhaps picking your trades a little better maybe? Like in life they say chose your battles.

Number 1 never ever trade without a stop loss. As others mentioned a power outage or market outage, internet connection anything really can ruin your account. Never do that again risk management and capital preservation is Rule Number 1!

Secondly there is an impulse wave there on the left with strong buying. This consolidation pattern is obviously going to break 1 of 2 ways and really speaking you want to be trading the direction of the trend. You can scalp counter trend sure but make sure you're experienced enough for that and check other entry conditions.

Just a candle stick formation itself is not really good signal. I love to look at delta for potential reversals.

There isn't enough data really here to short that based on a short term rejection zone

Here are the things that can kill your account:

-Power outage

-Internet outage

-Computer outage

-Frozen stock screen (brokerage app or your computer)

-Huge bid-ask spread (check before buying)

-Slippage in sell limit price

-Market buy or sell order (specifically with large bid-ask spread)

-Miss the price sell to avoid minimal loss - loss suddenly increases 10x if stock continues to go against you

-Sell order refuses to be entered into the system due to brokerage app glitch

-Sell order does NOT get filled even after being successfully entered into the system

-any other tech glitches on the brokerage's end

The absolute BEST way to avoid a huge loss in either of these cases is to have at least 2 other devices open AND use extremely small number of contracts PER position, aiming for no more than 1% of your account!

Speaking of devices, ALWAYS have the brokerage app installed on your phone and have it open. If any outage occurs, your phone will still work if your phone plan includes the internet, so you can close your position there. Practice closing positions on all of your devices. 

 I never use stop loss, I simply use minimal portion per position.

Currencies, Gold and silver are difficult to predict. But your friend is wrong. Gambling is randomly betting without risk management. Trading is betting with risk management and with a sentiment that prefers one direction of a price move.

You can survive there only with good risk management. You can trade clear trend with sort of trailing stop or daily adjustment of your stop loss, but consolidation as that on the screen could have a breakout to one or another side in every single second. Some news come out, events, business figures, unexpected inflation or unemployment figure and the price could go anywhwere.

Maybe not on commodities with clear supply and demand structure...

Entry was based off of these 4, 5min candles

https://preview.redd.it/4avcbwsxc38e1.png?width=1769&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7eb919df0e9daa3df14efd76b4614d2f3a657c

For those that don't know, these 3 candles signify buyer pressure increasing and can signal a potential reversal of a trend, entry was based off the 4th green candle showing strong momentum and creating buyer-side imbalance (FVG) and efficiencies afterwards.

https://preview.redd.it/d1pp7sosn38e1.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4f5e2b2c918462f58936f2618d04017d6dadfca

Exit was based off of signs of momentum slowing down/buyer side inefficiencies, meaning institutes don't have enough interest from others including retail traders causing less efficient buying power which can cause pull backs and ineffective attempts to keep pushing upwards (if that makes sense).

https://preview.redd.it/fa26hsdgo38e1.png?width=1771&format=png&auto=webp&s=5276a8032807f23b5c3dc83708c8b497123f176a

This can be seen more clearly here. More red candles started too form and not long after 3 small green candles which indicates a lack of interest. You will see similar instances after price has a huge spike after news, followed high pushing highs and forming many of these smaller candles before dumping. Confirmation of this would be the larger red candle after price attempted to push higher which is when I exited my position. I did short here too but did not stay in it due to seeing the Gold opportunity and knowing the short trade here could earn me another 5% but only as a short trade and would be a failing trade if I wished for anymore downside unlike the high potential of the Gold trade. Sorry for yapping. Hope this helped explain.

Did this based off the similar candle formation you can see on the daily, not only that but we have seen large amounts of accumulation after the major sell side imbalance and consolidation (lack of buyer/seller interest). after the consolidation, you can see the buyer side is still stronger than sell side due to 5 red candles having to undo the work 4 green candles did (probably sounds silly).

https://preview.redd.it/d2o4qzl3g38e1.png?width=1772&format=png&auto=webp&s=540e4f273e2a63ab9bafc8dd2cb229d4b7fa3d3c

This is a common occurrence after experiencing a sell-side imbalance. It is when large institutes accumulate many, smaller positions over a longer period of time which is often followed by a breakout and large momentum to the up-side.

https://preview.redd.it/kzalo9l1i38e1.png?width=1768&format=png&auto=webp&s=ca2ba150ec4527fc76944682110652d9b4a3195c

Candles like this, in this context usually indicate a momentum shift, hence why I jumped in.

Large 9% SL used in this trade due to the 80% gain potential I see in it, This is only due to it being a high reward swing trade.

Hope you enjoyed/learned something.

Can you explain on how to find your exit position?

Im perplexed by what you say about “inefficiencies” and “accumulation”- 

What do you mean by inefficiencies? 

Can you explain how the green bars you point to signify large institutions placing relatively small orders? They look like a few of many ordinary green bars to me. 

(Two months experience, so might be missing something.)

If you made 29% you had way too big size. Unless you were using 0DTE then maybe it was ok.

Bad news. By risking so much on one trade you'll lose it equally quickly. Just a matter of time.

\*blushes like a slut\*

Sorry, I did think about that not long ago. Updated it now.

Same question. Why are multiple green bars more important than multiple red bars

Daytrading,What am I missing?,"Hello, Everyone.

Can someone explain what’s happening? I'm new to trading and have been paper trading since October with a $500 account at 1:1 leverage. I've used a 15-30 pip stop loss and take profit strategy, risking $50 to make $100 -  ish, and was successfully growing my account at times and learning my psychology.

Now, suddenly I can't cover that risk—I even tried reducing it to $2, but I'm still getting a ""not enough funds"" error. Why was I able to trade without issues for months, sometimes risking $150  or more, only to run into this problem now? I reset my account to $1000 thinking there might be a glitch. What am I missing?

In the photo. I'm risking $1.50 to see how low I can go. With $999 in my account, How is that not enough money?

Thanks for any help!

1. You are buying in a downtrend, based only on the context of 5m, always focus on the higher timeframes, only take the position on the lowers.

2. Again, remember the trend is your friend. Don’t try to catch those little movements in between, they are not worth it if you are still trying to be profitable.

3. You are pointing that tp based on what? Remember to be realistic on your analysis and based on the time and volume of the session that you are trading.

Why long in a clear  downtrend 😭

why did you buy when the market is trending down?

Solid trade, two critiques from me, but it seems to just be a loser. 

I personally would have waited for the dip back into the order block instead of entering w/ the fvg, which the market did retrace to, but it would have stopped you out anyway.

Also given that it’s a bearish trend and bias I would have waited for a bearish signal and gone short instead of trying to catch the ultimate reversal. The trend is your friend. 

An entry could have been at that bearish liquidity sweep and break of structure in the place you got stopped out, you can see it came back in and is potentially forming an order block to go short.

[deleted]

I would have shorted to go with the dowward trend. The lower highs and lower lows are still being created.

I would have only considered a reversal if there was at least 2 bottoms creating a level of a support.

If the yellow line was a previously defined keylevel, yeah, I can see how that looks like a potential area for buyers to come in which looked like it wasn't enough to sustain the direction as more sellers said f it, i'm selling off.

I don’t understand how it’s a downtrend, i need to know how to identify the direction of the trend i looked at the 1h 4h D TF and it looked bullish(higher highs higher lows) i don’t understand why it is bearish, is it because of this 4h BOS?

It's not about gold... it's a restriction against CFD.

I'm pretty sure you can trade spot gold,gold futures (GC) or gold etf (GLD).

Spread. Enable the Bid/Ask on the chart to see the spread.

Don't trade before asian open, spreads go wild at this time.

That’s why you trade futures..

My reddit execution is on par with my trading execution

the price went down to your stop loss but it did not stay there long enough for the order to execute, and so when it didn't execute, the stop loss order stayed waiting for the price to go down again which it didn't,  very common occurrence when using stop loss orders on a narrow window, and a highly volatile stock.  not much you can do about it except watch the stock price constantly and manually execute the order

It’s the H4 traders driving the move which was the 5am candle Uk time, and it was 1st hour of the London session and entered at closing price.

Also a follow on trade you could look for the next day, because Wednesday  closed as a first red day (signal day) has to break a previous daily level to be a valid signal and how it setups on the next day is important too… this was the high of month level it broke so even better.

**My first trade idea - Josh - 33 years old** 👦

£100 equity could get you very far. Or not, and you might lose everything :)

XAU/USD significantly broke an ascending parallel channel (in purple) on the 1-hour chart today, creating an opportunity to go long.

Gold bounced off the support/resistance zone around $2714 with increased volume, forming a double bottom with clear buying pressure at this level.

There is also an approaching bullish MACD cross, and the RSI moving average has crossed, supporting the technical outlook (circled blue).

The technicals are further bolstered by strong fundamentals. Interest rates are coming down and are expected to continue declining. While there may be pauses in rate cuts and some promising economic data releases that could temporarily dampen the price of gold, this will only delay the precious metal’s ascent as rates eventually return to 2%-3%.

Safe-Haven Status: Gold has historically been an excellent hedge against inflation. Although inflation is now fading rapidly, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ have each appreciated around 20% year-to-date, compared with an average annual gain of 8%-12%. This means many investors are rebalancing portfolios, increasing demand for gold. This type of behavior can become self-fulfilling—as demand for gold and risk-off assets rises and demand for stocks decreases, both rallies and corrections can ensue.

Daytrading,Further Examples of Support and Resistance,"About a month, I shared some basic examples of how to utilise [Support and Resistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1fpjzb0/understanding_support_and_resistance_lines/) on Reddit. Gotten a number of DMs from traders for more examples. I've been busy monitoring my own forex algo but I spotted some further examples to share here.

As a recap:

1. The key mistake is most traders look at 5M - 15M timeframe (TF). Those lines tend to be noisy and untested. The minimum you shoud look at it 1H timeframe. Once you get more experience, you could consider doing 15M
2. Find a level with most rejection or contact points. When you have more than 3 contact points, the more valid it is.

Giving two examples:

**22 Oct 24 03:00 (Hong Kong time)**

XAU/USD idea

https://preview.redd.it/vzh7xfqmoiwd1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e95577122704d60b5eb76ef788449b03d4144c8

Gold price revisited price of $2,714 which was previously a nice suppport and resistance zone between 18 Oct 13:30 to 19 Oct 01:30. You can see how well the price was hovering around the price and bounced off it. I counted a total contact point of 4, solidfying that zone.

https://preview.redd.it/pkibc17hoiwd1.png?width=2475&format=png&auto=webp&s=58f231efe533e1272b4d4d54332df72be7be224b

The placement of SL is crucial, place it below the previous wicks were and give it some buffer. You do not want it to be taken out so quickly just to see the price reversed upwards.

**22 Oct 24 03:00 (Hong Kong time)**

GBP/USD idea

https://preview.redd.it/q5kmzuwbriwd1.png?width=2459&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3bcd8cea787a1807eca11190c90a6d3b70186c

Cable retraced back to 1.298 level and it was proven to be a very strong support level previously. It took a long while before it bounced back up again. For this trade idea, SL needs to be longer to accomodate the longer wicks previously, still, it would be a nice R:R return.

Yeah 15m can work doesn’t have to be 1h. More contact points isn’t necessarily good if the order strength is running out, like if it’s an ascending triangle. It’s really about supply and demand right

Hey, thanks for sharing! Where is the swing trading sub and is this not considered day trading?

Since forex is open 24 hours, maybe any trade held less than 24 hours is a day trade. I noticed you used two 15m charts, not the 1 H as you recommended earlier. So 15m works for you too?

Yeah, my trades tend to close out usually within 2 - 3 hours. I thought it's appropriate to be posted here. 15M is the lowest I'll go for manual trades! However, I do believe higher timeframes tend to be more stable and better for beginners.

Daytrading,how do you handle taxes as a day trader living in the US?,"specifically i trade forex using oanda and my understanding is that they actually don't send any tax forms to clients or communicate with the IRS lol.. 

now, the IRS can still audit bank accounts and look at money that is being deposited into your account due to oanda withdrawals and question whether taxes are being paid on this or not

so eventually when you go to withdraw there will be a record in your bank account of you getting the funds

from what i understand, the way you are supposed to do it is every time you make a profitable trade you need to set aside some money from the trade to pay taxes on it

i'm wondering how many people do this though because the concept just seems silly

if you're starting out and building your trading capital, any gains you make you're going to want to re-deposit that back into your trading account to build your capital and trade bigger positions

so having to capital gains tax on these profits before you reinvest it just seems straight up dumb and i wonder how many people are doing that lol

i can understand if you're trading forex as your only source of income

in that case, you should withdraw however much money you need to live and pay taxes on that. anything in excess you put it back into your trading account to build up your capital

if you are trading part time and have a job that covers all your living expenses, you could withdraw enough profits to cover the expenses for your business. that way your business sees a small gain just so it looks like you've earned some money for the year

the rest of the money you just put it back into your trading account to trade with lol

of course you would have your emergency fund which is a separate thing and don't need to build that up anymore

essentially any extra money you make would be put back into your trading account

the only issue tho is the IRS could technically audit your bank accounts and see you're receiving all this money from your broker and wondering if you paid taxes on it lol

idk

it's either that or pay taxes on every withdrawal that you make which is what they want you to do

that's so dumb though because you should be reinvesting all the money anyway to build up your capital lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1g571em/how_do_you_handle_taxes_as_a_day_trader_living_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1g571em/how_do_you_handle_taxes_as_a_day_trader_living_in/,4,17,2024-10-16 18:54:45,nervomelbye,"OANDA should be sending some paperwork but if they don't I imagine it's under your info come tax time. You can request it from them as well.

I withdrawal 60% of my gains to pay bills….  Of the other 40%, I leave I. The margin account to leverage until tax time….  30% of gains should go to taxes and that 10% just helps my account grow…. But compounding gains off of what I will owe on taxes is the best strategy I have found to work for me…

I pretend like the IRS doesn’t exist. Because they don’t care about someone with under $1million.

They’re so backlogged it would take 4 years for them to catch up.

i checked oanda's site: https://help.oanda.com/us/en/faqs/tax-filing-and-forms.htm

>OANDA does not report taxes on behalf of our clients, and as such, we do not provide any tax forms relating to profit/loss on your account (e.g. 1099-B form). Your annual account statement may help you with your tax reporting. You can download your annual account statement from the HUB by clicking on Statements .

so... if they don't even communicate or send anything to the IRS at all, then what now lol

the way they want people to do it is after each profitable trade, pay the taxes on it

this assumes you are consistently profitable and can be overall profit for the year

in this case they'd want ppl to pay the estimated quarterly taxes instead of paying all the tax at the end of the year

the way that makes sense to me is use however much profits to pay for your living for the year, then list this as your business profit and pay tax on it

the rest of the profits don't list it and just reinvest it back into your trading capital

idk if you're allowed to do that though, prob not

the alternative is mega stupid though, paying capital gains tax on each withdrawal of a profitable trade, even if you're gonna end up reinvesting that money back into your trading capital. just lol

That’s crazy, Oanda does do sus shit, I tried to close my account for the longest time and I had linked a savings account to it to fund it and that savings account closed and they don’t let me update the banking info so I had like $100 there that I figure is $0 now because they kept charging $10/month for “inactivity fee”. Anyway I looked through my archives and for the brief time I used Amp, they provided something so idk if Oanda on the up and up.

Anytime you sell a stock that’s what you pay taxes on.

Not when you move it from the brokerage to your bank account.

that's futures

oanda in the US you can only trade spot currency pairs

you can't even trade gold on oanda in the US, just eur/usd, aud/usd, etc

i'm trading forex, not stocks

with stocks they actually issue you reports and your brokerage sends the forms to the IRS, i even think for that there is a way your accountant has to report the trading activity on your tax return. not sure if your accountant would do the same for forex trades, need to speak to mine regarding this"

On the daily it very close to where it may bounce on an uptrend line. pullback.

I’ve been watching it too.

update: the two trades i took on this are working out well

trading during a trend is pretty simple, from my limited experience

the issue that really screws people over is trading during a trend reversal, that one is a real test of skill

i think during the first 2 weeks of every month when news comes out you typically will see a trend reversal

trading during that is really difficult though, really really difficult

my current trade: https://i.gyazo.com/744e65b3ac448fada759e86d7f587232.png

this is textbook... https://i.gyazo.com/a71e27c42255e07e911773c7aa144567.png

rally, 50% retracement, then rally again equal height of the previous rally

if only more people knew about trading to make money lol... 15% of forex traders are retail people, even though you can literally just trade these charts and make your living that way

Monday sets the opening range of week, and it expanded the range from Fridays closing range, 
Tuesday typically will be when larger range expansion occur (initial balance)

So you if it continues the trend tomorrow will be a day it’s more likely to expand the range 100-200%

Another thing to note it’s closed in breakout 3 days in a row.. that can lead to big explosives, either large reversal or blowoffs in the direction of the trend. Good luck bro. I’ll be looking to take a position in it tomorrow.

Depends if my setup presents :)

why not just take a position now with a limit order

Because my setup isn’t there.. I will know by tomorrow by how the first sessions play out, I was going to take a position today but chose gold as my template presented on that with much higher potential pip return, which it did work out to be.

what's your set up

Various ones, 3 session setups, 3 day setups, sometimes  signal days like FRD, FGD inside days etc
Prefer reversal trading but also take the trend breakout trades for range expansions, all the setups involve a pump and dump template, only focus on the parabolic moves, that go from high or low/ closing price to the of day to low or high of day week or month etc.

It’s all focused on timings at levels and behaviour of price. 

3 levels of rise or fall before the timing windows.

3 levels may be 75 pips or 150 pips or 300 all depends on the instrument.

would not just place a limit order at the next opportunity"

So I just lewt price run up to my SL, if I had seen the double bottom earlier I would have hopped out on the 15m candle formation but I really wanna know does this count as a triple bottom, double bottom or does it not matter?

The key level should be retested after price has made a significant move away from it(key level) Patterns are not established by 3 candlesticks

I made my money going long off of that bottom. I seem to remember there was a double bottom and then a higher low, looks like a triple bottom but not quite on lower timeframes. There was some good rsi divergence on the 5m around that double bottom so I waited for a squeeze and got in. Still going up now!

Edit. I traded NQ so it might look a little different on Nas100

On the 1 minute chart it's a double bottom. On the hourly it's a big wick. Look at it with multiple time frames and it's easier to figure out.

Just my opinion , from my understanding, when i look for patterns i look for an actual W or an M. That looks like support on the 15m but what does it look like on a lower TF?

on other time frames, it should count as a double bottom. 

on 15 minute, consolidating in a range those 3 bars. Building a decent case for a long. i tried to get long around here myself, but I watched the 1 minute only. it worked quite well

Maybe on the 1 min timeframe it's a triple bottom, but 3 candles in a row tapping the same level isn't a triple bottom on the 15 min chart. It needs to come into the level reject, and then come back and reject, and then come back and reject one more time to be a triple bottom.

yes can be

...

that is neither a double, nor a triple bottom.

i think you need to stop trading and spend a few months just studying

I don't use much TA, I have learnt from just watching this stuff print for 8-15 hours everyday for the past 2/3 weeks. Now reason why I am here is because I would like to give some advice which has helped me. 

  
1. Make notes of your mistakes. I have notes in front of me and on my wall above my monitor. These are mistakes that I make which are common. All mistakes I make are jotted down for me to read regularly.

2. trust your calls, let your SL hit, don't be afraid to be wrong but you must trust your original judgement.

3. Find a reason to exit your position, TP are good cause it removes the interference of emotions and greed but finding a reason to exit your positions I believe can make you a better trader although you must monitor your trades constantly. 

4. Learn self-discipline. You will NOT make it far if you do not learn self-discipline. I make myself uncomfortable by being cold and workout to get warm. Clean your rooms/house. This will help. Self-discipline is defined by doing something you don't want to do, when you don't want to do it. 

I still make mistakes, stupid ones but I am learning and you can and will. The mistakes I make are becoming alot less common and good trades and predictions based off experience is increasing. 

Learn how the market moves and reacts in whatever you trade, beware of news and seek constant growth. 



You will make it if you don't give up. Keep pushing and you will achieve your goals. Hope this helps.

It’s up trending. Buy the dip. What made you buy in at the point you did?

[removed]

Well since we know when you entered from your last post we can see that you waited it out (fair enough though because it didn't hit your SL and you also didn't move it further down - good job)

You added to your winning position (I assume when price rose over your entry and you got confidence in your trade)

And you let your winner run and it's probably still running.

All in all not bad since you trade in the right trend direction. About your entry and when you added - you can work on that. What I would've done differently:

1. You've drawn yourself a solid trendline - why are you not using it? Your entry should be after the trend continuation (bounce off of the trend line). Look out for confirmation candles but don't wait too long since price can rise without you and leave you behind. Look on a lower timeframe for a better entry if price tends to move without you.

2. Don't be afraid to add to a losing position if it's still the correct trade. When I happen to get a bad entry I'll not scare away to add to my position on that point where I should've entered in the first place! In your case right around your trendline!! Usually I would never advise someone to do that exact thing but if you are confident that price will rise or fall (in whichever direction you're trading) it's not a bad move to add even though the position might be losing right now.

All in all you seem to have grasped the concept of price action. Work on your confidence to enter on a good point. In your example price is very very likely to rise further since it bounced almost perfectly from your trendline. If you have confirmation that price will likely rise further, what are you waiting for? Be aggressive and use these situations because that's where you'll make money.

Entry too late. Stop loss too wide

Just saw your post, and from the looks of it, your trade is riding a solid uptrend! You’ve drawn a nice trendline supporting the price action, which looks like a good move. The buy limit is well-placed near the trendline, giving you a good entry point. The take-profit level also seems reasonable, right before resistance, allowing you to secure gains before a possible reversal. Just keep an eye on that support, and if it breaks, you might want to reassess your stop-loss to minimize risk.

If you’d like, I can share some resources that helped me refine my entries and exits early on!

i ended up modifying the trade, this is it now: https://i.gyazo.com/dcd0287b5fb15ac479d247060b31f8b2.png

Hey mate, just wanted to thank you for bringing this trade to my alert and full analysis. 

After reading the news and charts, I decided that AUDUSD was falling, and posted for advice about 15 hours ago. And since then, AUDUSD has dipped by 1.14%! Cheers mate.

it's gonna go up

i've been scalping this sht for 2 hours this morning, back and forth back and forth

as you can see, three higher lows have formed, during my scalping bullsht session

that's confirmation

put in a long order and now gonna just wait

i should be able to win that and get all my money back and then profit, then another day of the same bullsht with the scalps

look at my latest post

this is an older trade, it executed at take profit number, long position

Did you see it just broke below the previous high, forming a lower high and lower low? Its coming to my buy order price now. 

if you are trading on the weekly chart, I would understand your rationale. But you are scalping? 

I hate those days when catching profit feels like you’re trying to catch a slippery pig. And then in your head you’re like “alright little bastard, I got you now” haha

I’ve had the same issue with IWM today. Finally gave up after getting whipsawed several times

idk man, everyone trades differently

from my perspective, your trading seems off

you are saying a lot of stuff in hindsight, like you're trying to get in when the price is the absolute lowest, it's never gonna be like that and you'll only know that after the fact

not sure why you wanna keep hounding on price action that already happened

future price action is completely unknown

i trade on various time frames

i scalp when i can't tell what the market is doing

and if i can tell or a pattern starts to form, then i take a longer trade

i probably shouldn't scalp at all and just wait until i can take a longer trade, but i'm still new and learning. so i just decide to scalp and go back and forth for a few hours, usually resulting in losses

usually i trade in the mornings for a couple of hours, until i can put in a big long position, then just wait

but i work from home so i have the ability to trade even 4 or 5 hours straight in front of my computer if i want to. other people may not be able to do this so their trading strategies will vary

When the price was around this week’s high, you posted this as your entry, and then i said prices would be going down in order for me to enter. 

Then, prices fell and I updated you here. Which part of my first or second reply looks like hindsight to you?

From your explanation, you said you are new and you fully well that you probably shouldn’t trade, yet you decide to scalp for a few hours resulting in losses, sinply because you can afford the time? Is that what you are saying? 

Why don’t you devote the time to learning first?

But hey, the money is yours, i have no say in how you want to trade. Go ahead and do what you want to do, I have no intention of arguing with you. I merely posted out what I see and your defensive response tells me that there’s no point in debating. Im in the market to make money in trading, nothing else

gotcha

right now i'm actually trading on a demo account, so none of the wins or losses is real to me

my thing is that i'm trying to actually win, not lose

yeah scalping for a few hours is probly something i shouldn't do, or maybe i should do it, i'm not 100% sure

i'm still new and trying things out, seeing what works

you said you would enter if prices go down to the previous support level

yeah dude, obviously lol. everyone would do that.. there's no point to say that

the question is IF prices will go down to that level, maybe they will, maybe they won't

using past price action to dictate entry doesn't work imo. better off just entering and then setting a target based on your strategy"

You taken a short while price is going long, you’re just hoping it will reverse.

I would have waited for a larger reversal confirmation, too early for any confirmations for me. 

Plus you are going short while the last 10 candle have mostly been green. 

If you win this trade I feel like it’s still a bad trade that got lucky because of the info above 

Good luck tho 🤞

Me personally I would’ve waiting for more of a confirmation before pulling the trigger. Could honestly run up and double top near your stop loss before it reverses back down.

Sorry for your loss bro

looks decent, you probably should of waited into there is some kind of slowing down in the spike before placing the puts

I will not comment about your specific position/trade, but you should really be more aware of macro factors that drive this pair and all of Forex. We are less than 24 hours into a 50bp cut by the FOMC. You have a BOE meeting ending in 2 hours, and then the BOJ meeting on Friday. That is some massive macro risk, that could take this trade in any direction at the drop of a hat. If you want to trade strictly on chart patterns, then going forward, try to do it during times with less expected random volatility.

These events can make the price gap significantly, which could mean your stop loss gets executed a lot farther away than you might imagine. It looks like your stop loss is at 1.32850? I would not be surprised if this gaps 1/2 a point or more through that, and you get a fill above 1.3300.

Why did you get in so early?

Upward trendline, higher highs and higher lows. Solid analysis and it hit TP but trading right before Powell speaks is gutsy.

why not?

thank you

your thoughts on this one?

https://i.gyazo.com/2f6507e2de48d05f87f908373ca1da2f.png

Because by going in so early you are still not in break even zone and your stop is retardly big compared to the trend. 

Like you even drew the trendlines. Couldve waited until it broke that line and start climbing up to place a bid to further minimize your loss zone

This one’s more riskier since the trendline support broke with momentum and it created a lower low. 

Would only take this if price went back down to the low and reacted with a double confirmation (bullish bar or pin bar).

what do you mean?

this is a 1:1 risk to reward ratio

yeah we'll see

what i've been doing is looking at 5 pairs and when i'm ready to  make a trade, check them all out and see which is in the easiest position to make a simple profit

ideally i'd like to get at least 20 pips of movement, but i'll take at least 10 pips if all pairs aren't looking that good..

and also, i look at aud/usd and usd/chf first, espeically aud/usd

the cost per pip on those is so much higher, can make good money"

Just wait for confirmation

I definitely wouldn’t have taken it. You should have taken one of the last 2 legs ups before it just starting sitting there.

I already caught the first big move of this uptrend and entered again in this consolidation. It still is maintaining a bullish structure, and the range is more likely to continue up when it is still in an uptrend (it hasn't broken the last higher low yet). That being said my new entry is only going with a 1:1.6 RR because I feel the trend will be over soon, looks like it has one last push and then I'll look to short it.

Stay out. Likely a liquidity sweep below support. I’m seeing a strong possible swing wick to the downside before continuing up. Wait for confirmation, do not take a trade.

Daytrading,Trade Review EUR/USD,"Recap on a trade I opened Sept. 6th, closed on the 10th.

The structure of EUR/USD was bearish on the 15m chart as seen by the bearish break of structure here:

[Bearish BOS](https://preview.redd.it/ck00tet95bod1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=de072fb73d785bd79c67d78303cdf4a8d9eccdd4)

May be a little hard to see, but the internal structure flipped back bearish after a mitigation of supply in the discount:

This led to a great entry at the newly formed supply zone of the internal structure, with the target being the current swing low (continuation of the 15m bearish structure). The internal structure continued all the way to our target:

Price action is not normal these days... Something is about to change drastically.

No, it's not normal to take a picture of your laptop screen.

My 1 min chart for GBP/USD Oanda on tradingview looks smooth and normal, not sure what happened to yours.

Tradingview had an error on the data stream from oanda yesterday.  I trade Wti (oil) and from 15.15 cet, the oanda chart on tradingview slowed down, to lag 1-5 mins behind other brokers charts on tradingview.  It persisted for 45 minutes and during that time my chart got prints, like you se on yours.  When it was all corrected and data stream on tradingview normalized to normal time, prints got corrected.  I checked the Oanda mobile app during this time and it did not lag.  So it was a tradingview issue.  Funny thing is according to tradingview uptime monitor. Nothing was wrong at the time…(they don’t seem to count a broken, slowed data stream to a broker as a problem).

[deleted]

I saw the same thing yesterday, and my broker was moving perfectly fine, something might be wrong with tradingview or the OANDA Charts, anyone who trades with OANDA??

Mine did something similar today as well, for some reason, only on my trading view chart. I think my internet was glitching and it might have been that but it didnt do it on my charts on other websites, so probably something to do with tradingview bc its only happening there, but it might be triggered by your internet being laggy or slow

It looks like the market is thin. What time did this happen?

I see you are using the Oanda feed.  If you are using Trading View this means that their server retrieved the data straight from the Oanda server or a third-party data provider. This doesn't have anything to do with your hardware or internet connectivity. You can always load up the Oanda application and see if this looks the same. I know from experience that FX OTC brokers aggregate their data from multiple FX sources.

There is a big difference between trading with OTC FX and Futures Exchange."

Definitely, but there's a difference. In video games, there is no penalty for dying besides frustration. You can just respawn. There are no respawns in the market. It plays like a video game but the stakes are so much higher. You don't just turn on the markets and play because you're bored. 

Thinking it can be won is the wrong mentality. It can't be won. It's only how well you can survive. Think of it like a survival type game where there are no bosses and no real objectives. You build yourself indestructible safety measures and then simply walk out when there are no predators and gather your berries. That's it.

EDIT: I forgot to add that sometimes what looks like a berry is actually a scorching hot ICBM pointed at your head with a 5 second countdown. Move your head out of the way of that berry and go back inside.

A video game is a dopamine machine. Dopamine in the market is dangerous.

And I made the connection that the stock market is that game to an extent. APM does matter in day trading but not as much as it does in SC2

Yes. In fact my entire education through school was based around the concept that wealth development is really just a game, video or otherwise. You can either choose to play or choose not to. If you choose not to play, you can't win. Most people choose not to play.  
  
If you choose to play, the worst that can happen is you can only lose until you become good at the game.

Imagine game chat.

That's exactly where buyers would step in if they are watching (and they were).

You should always place your stop based on market structure, ie: in this instance below previous price action lows. You can also see it tapped that moving average and got bought up, again, buyers would be at those levels.

The most important part of a trade is the exits (both stop and target). They need to be at logical levels to give the trade a proper chance at working out.

No way to predict it but a way to prep it to use structure those extra points in SL won’t hurt you if it means more wins that structure that started the moves would’ve been a great spot for your SL a slightly bigger SL that you adjust your risk too never hurt anyone

One way to counteract this is make sure your sl has a buffer or a breather to avoid being liquidity hunted make sure your stop loss has a buffer and at the same time still adheres to your risk management plan to avoid over leveraging I've traded like this for like the past 18 months and it works wonders  once in a while you will get stopped out  but you'll win more on the trades that  you initially used to get wicked  out  on and went back to your direction.

That’s why you should always follow the trend with your stop loss

Research ""Orderblocks"". They are around for ages. If there is an orderblock below your entry it is best practise to put your stop below the orderblock, rather than inside or above it. They are very helpful tools.

Why do you guys not queehat ur told? Ur told that swings or pivots are support and resistance. 
Your told to use thrm as stoplosses.

And then u constantly get stopped out.

But nit one of u ever thinks to question HOW TO VALIDATE a swing.

Also if a swung is support or resistance, then why woykd u put ur stoploss there knowing price needs to bounce off support or resistance?

Your stop shouldve been at BE by the time it started to come against you.

The market is completely random, it might have been pure coincidence. Take a look of a number of your trades and then see if getting stopped out is common and if so, consider making adjustments.

how do people trade with indicators ? why would u need indicators ? they dont work. learn price action lol fvg and liquidity is all you need.

I’m only like 2-3 days into trading on a demo so correct me if I’m wrong but based on what I’m looking at you entered at a ‘new’ higher low. I would have waited for another before entering. Especially since seeing 2 higher highs to the previous ones. What analysis made you enter at this point?

Where did you get the strategy from?

Stop losses are the worst and same time one of the most important thing to have in every trade."
Daytrading,90% of day traders lose? Here’s why.,"One thing that always caught me off guard is how you always hear 90% of day traders quit or lose money & fail. Why?

So in my time now ive done some research. There was a study of I think FXCM and it was of 25,000 traders and 43 million trades. The average pip gain was 4.2 pips and the average loss was 8.2 pips. So that tells you risk management or holding winners is a huge factor. 

Second off I’ve seen broker like oanda say that 70% of their clients are profitable which I think is true, but there was statistics on a prop firm that said out of 100 traders that passed phase 1 only 24% went to pass phase 2. Out of 24 people who passed out phase 1, only 8% went to get a payout. I think that’s a psychological issue personally. 

& then last but not least , an actual edge in the market and entries😂it gets really easy after practicing anticipation of direction, usually it’s people entries that get them caught up , SL too big or too tight, entering in at random areas & I always noticed everyone who is new to trading 80% of them start on lower timeframes 30 min and below with no regards of the higher timeframes. Well I’ll say this, you banks and hedge funds do not trade on a 5 minute chart! They use higher timeframes! And all the LTF signals all derive from higher timeframes so why not trade them? Or at least be in line with your weekly and monthly direction. Because most want instant gratification and can’t grasp waiting a day or two for your trade to win or lose.

Any thoughts????",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1cy1hir/90_of_day_traders_lose_heres_why/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1cy1hir/90_of_day_traders_lose_heres_why/,1,53,2024-05-22 14:23:30,GrapefruitCurious502,"Broker statistics are irrelevant as it's in their own self-interest to present trading as a profitable endeavor if clients just try hard enough. The reality is that over the very long-term, talking year after year after year, very few traders are profitable. I would put good money the number is less than 1% of traders are profitable long-term. Does anyone seriously believe 7 out of 10 Oanda clients are profitable in the long-term? 7 out of 10 might be profitable for any given month or quarter, but not year after year.

How many of those traders spent years learning, practicing and mastering their emotions?  Anyone who puts money into an account and makes a trade is considered a ""trader."" Now think of how many only watched a few youtube videos before trying it out.

Trading isn't so hard that only the top 1-5% can succeed, the failure rate is high because it has no entry requirements or standards as to what a ""trader"" is.  Anyone with internet access and a bank account can become a ""trader.""

The only way to really know the failure rate is to have some type of standard or requirement that proves a person is as committed to trading as they would be to other professions such as going to medical school to become a doctor or taking the bar exam to become a lawyer. 

Ironically people often use the high failure rate as an excuse to quit before giving it their all, further contributing to the failure rate.

I know it's an average number, but imagine being happy with just 4 pips for a typical trade!

You know I feel like this was your journal entry where you tried convince yourself to trade HTF. You sound biased. And bias is your enemy in trading. I read your comment about Oanda as well. Btw its a cheap broker, $100 is not big amount and I am from a third world country. Also how can 70% be profitable off of 30% donors? Statistics are confusing. The big banks and institutions dont always trade HTF, their algorithms scalp milliseconds and if you go LTF you can see fresh meat eaten every minute. Then this fresh meat decides to try HTF and its a slower death.

Brokers quote losing traders for each quarter separately (about 70%). Those who don't lose they really don't have any trading skills, it is just natural distribution of probabilities. 70% number is very misleading and brokers know about it, but it is in their favour. Study shows that after one year 97% of traders are in red. This is how market efficiency (randomness) and spread cost is catching up with you. Let them trade for another year and probably 99.5% of them will be in red.

It’s simply because they don’t know what they’re doing. It takes a good 4-5 years of hard work to be consistently profitable. Most start, hit a lucky trade and win big, then oversize into the next ones and go bust. 90% of traders fail because it’s freaking hard. Tell 9 out of 10 random people that they can have access to an unlimited money supply but they must learn about it and be extremely disciplined. How do you think it’s going to go?

100% of trades lose money. Some of us just make more than we lose.

Interestingly, my impulsive entries on a demo account yield better results than my well-thought-out strategies when trading with real money.

Good write up. I started out on low time frames because I thought I could snipe entries that way and it’s what I saw people using online in all the seductive videos. I started seeing a big difference as I zoomed out to higher time frames. Not only in my results but also in my psychology.

Daytrading,Did I get lucky with this trade ?,"Thought I played this alright, but during the trade buyers kept eating up any downward pressure and it was consolidating for a while before it broke to the downside. Did I get lucky in this case with the trade and my entry? I zoomed out to the M3 on the photo as it looks cleaner than the M1 which I used for my LTF analysis and entry… ",https://i.redd.it/p971w5ymc60d1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1cqwe1x/did_i_get_lucky_with_this_trade/,0,7,2024-05-13 10:54:19,London_dealer42,"Yes. The trend was heading down but I can’t see any reason why you’d enter where you did. It could easily have stopped you out then headed back down again.

Why did you enter the trade?

No, great entry and you stuck it out. Good stuff

Price hit HTF supply zone, looking for reversal entries now. On M1 had a Market structure break, created a ChoCH OB I had drawn on the chart this was my area for entry. I saw there was a small FVG above the OB so I placed my SL few pips above there incase price swept the OB. I anticipated if price swept this static liquidity it would react to the dynamic liquidity within this FVG, so I saw my SL as appropriate in the case of avoiding being swept and keeping a RR that was worth placing the trade…

This wouldn’t be reliable enough for me. Using lower time frames to find your entry is great, but the 1m chart vs 3m chart isn’t reliable in the slightest. A three candle reversal on the 1m chart is just one candle on the 3m: it doesn’t really tell you anything, especially since the price has only just hit the supply zone.

I do something similar but in reverse: I trade off the 5m chart and use the 30m chart to see if the longer trend is going my way. The entry for me IS the supply or demand zone.

See a trade I did this morning: as soon as price hits supply on the 5m chart, I confirm if there is a downward trend on the 30m chart. Since there was buying pressure just below, I went for a 1:1.

https://preview.redd.it/qcqll790z60d1.png?width=4032&format=png&auto=webp&s=d5c4a351c93c2dab05f226580a1f234fbdd41e6e

Has your way worked out for you a lot? It took me almost a year and a ton of strategies in the bin to get me to this point.

(That white line is a 100EMA on the 30m chart btw, replicated as a 600EMA on the 5m chart).

Each to their own I guess. From what I can see yh that particular trade is quite conservative. I would’ve personally set my TP at the OB which price actually ran to. I see you put your SL at the swing high which is fair enough, however have you backtested that same strategy putting the SL above the supply zone or above the MA and seen the results? Maybe your RR might improve?

Yeah believe it or not my RR is better when I hit lots of little wins. There are trades I make, like another one today on GBPUSD, where I think “Shit I missed out there”, but you just don’t know 🤷🏻‍♂️ Take a look; there was a bunch of resistance around 1.2536 which is just above my TP. It did pull back and at first I was happy I’d taken the profit, but then it marched back up again.

https://preview.redd.it/swcp4c2xc70d1.jpeg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1ea75d5182d92a71cac2e84c7a29a111d6812991

But, it’s a win nonetheless and I’m just glad I can get more than I get losses.

Yeah the reason price has done that is because it has swept the liquidity built at around 1.254, and then price has ran to a supply zone on the H1 around 1.2568 so your trade was definitely a high probability trade but you could’ve let it run more to that supply zone. I think your strategy is good and you could definitely make it more aggressive if you trade to HTF zones but if you find your RR is more successful sticking to 1:1 then that’s a W in itself"

Shift of structure would be above the previous high or low, Consolidation, at around 1.14200ish to 1.14350ish.

The next internal high/low directly above your circled area might be considered a “change of character” or whatever they call it, a break of internal structure, but not the best one I reckon.

By internal structure I mean trends forming within trends, fractal price structure, within every move there is a trend on a smaller scale.

If you are unsure and struggle to identify structure, throw on a 20 period exponential moving average. That should visually help to identify the larger structure based on the lows and highs of the EMA.

Price already took out internal liquidity so there isnt any need to take out that low, also you shouldn't be trading since there is a high impact news that day.

1st one isn't a swing low. 2nd one is.

And the one that you thought was liquidity sweep is a rebalancing into a BISI. After it went to an external range liiquidity, it went back to an internal range liquidity.

Your lines don't mean what you think they mean...I just saw a video on this on YT's wallstreetplunger channel...

The extreme swing points(external] are the most important liquidty points

Something you might try is Saty Mahajan ATR levels.  I bet that pin was right into a major level. 

Use the bottom of the range and a smaller size. You’re going to always become someone else’s liquidity trying that. Always.

Are you looking at the actual orderbook information?

A “liquidity sweep” is when the exchange matching engine has a single Event Sequence Number which matches orders on multiple price levels, and the information is sent out in the same data packet

Your stops are too close and you’ll get top/bottom ticked on the reversal. 

Focus on better entries - that’s the culprit here, and widen your stops. Maybe 1.5% of ATR, or some other acceptable level of risk. 

Entries, timing, and a dash of luck. 


@tronbronson - that is exactly what they did. It’s called a pullback. Get used to it and trade those; that is your entry point.

Brother go Apex site right now and get you a 25k funded account for $30 a month. The trailing drawdown repels most bad traders because they don’t have any discipline. You’ll most likely blow it up a few times and that will teach you how emotional trading works, proper risk management and know when to walk away from the computer on bad days it’s quite literally the best deal you’re gonna find right now. However, do not get a funded account unless you are completely ready via weeks of being profitable using a good strategy in a paper account. It’s a marathon not a sprint.

Save up more money while you papertrade. If you just rush in and start ""clicking buttons"" based on how you feel. You will be broke before the end of your first month. 

The market is not going anywhere it will be here when you find a strategy that resonates with you. 

Once you have successfully papertraded your strategy and are actually making money.  You can test it in a real market setting with 500 to 1000 bucks and figure out the emotional aspect and risk management with small amounts of capital that you dont mind losing. Because lets be real, there are zero emotions papertrading. It's alot harder to let a trade play when there's actually money on the table.

Once you double this first 500 / 1000 using proper risk management following a trackable strategy.. take half of it out and do it again... 

When you can make money in a real live setting by followijg a well thought out plan and executing your strategy flawlessly,  you will have saved up plenty of money to fund an actual trading account. 

Now you may deposit that 

Rush it.. and youll get nothing.

But since you're so pushy lol, I don't mess with funded accounts or futures. I'm not doing a tryout for no firm for a privilege to get funded and get paid once a month. I get paid 5 days a week in the market multiple times a day. Not knocking anyone who does but it's not my thing. So I can't answer you lol.

I have practiced and gotten a strategy that seems to work well for me already so I guess im not a total beginner just like very amateur

Daytrading,I just had a huge realisation about indicator based strategies.,"So as we know, price action is king, and indicators are lagging. 
So I started back testing indicator strategies but using a negative risk to reward and the results shocked me. If you can be happy with a 10pip take profit and 15 pip stop loss the win rate went through the roof. 
Because indicators show price AFTER the majority of the move has happened, hence they are lagging. So having a tighter take profit and a larger stop loss on these strategies makes sense. Because you’re only looking for the last push of that big move so no need to target a massive reward. 
In this strategy, the TP is 10 pips and the SL is 15 pips. The high win rate could benefit psychology too if you’re ok with bigger than normal drawdowns. ",https://i.redd.it/kq78bp25qloc1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1bfuqp0/i_just_had_a_huge_realisation_about_indicator/,163,125,2024-03-16 01:47:02,Throwaway_765491,"I’d say live test it as well with a demo or u just keeping track cause some indicators will show it at first then take it away when it goes against so it looks more accurate than it is

With this RR you will be profitable if your win rate is above 60% (the break even win rate with this RR).

Got burned not sticking to something similar like this today. Didn’t set my sell limit and wanted to hold for greed, boy oh boy did it roll back on me and took hours to get out right.

But yea, I trade very similarly on indicators; it’s smaller wins but it’s consistent wins. When I want to make more money, I just increase the size of the position instead of moving the finish line.

Teach me to use this somehow and I will personally put a thousand into it and report after 3 months

I’ll admit that’s an interesting idea/perspective, even if it doesn’t end up working or isn’t practical. Negative R:R can still be profitable in the right circumstances, but that doesn’t mean it’s not challenging on your psychology to trade it though.

So, in general I’d still recommend using a positive R:R approach, but with the following in mind:

When it comes to indicators, they need to be filtered by context. What makes indicators “so bad” to many traders is that they’re used blindly, where the trader takes every signal. Indicators aren’t meant to be used that way.

Instead, you filter out many of the false signals by using context. For example, you can combine indicator signals with key areas on the chart. Maybe you only take long signals when price has reached a key strong area of support, stuff like that. The move needs a catalyst of some kind, something that *causes* price to move or react.

Or, you can combine the signals with trend structure, only taking long signals in uptrending conditions, and so if it’s ranging or trending down, you ignore long signals.

I don't trade indicators.

However, my scalping models would generally put me very close to your entries.

12 handle stop loss / 10 handle take profit (NQ) generally seems like the sweet spot for that style of trading.  


The high win rate is a lot easier pyschologically.

Create a BOT so you can remove all biases. Sometimes your biases are unintentional. The indicator prints late, entry and exit are favorable, slippage, etc.

My strategy is very similar to this. After 8 odd months I'm profitable with a 77% win rate. 

Relies on you taking profit though. Lots of small wins. 

Find the balance in the market between fear and greed and take your 10 pips as consistently as you can.

This realisation was exactly what flipped me from loss making to profitable!!

I realised predicting reversals is easy, predicting whether it's a true reversal or a brief pullback is HARD. So if you can give plenty of room for SL and be happy with a 1:1 ratio, or sometimes even less, then making money is a LOT easier. You can still give moves with big momentum room to breath by moving up your TP and trailing SL, which gives the odd big win.

Ultimately it's a less sexy strategy than one which gives bit gains on winners, but I've found it way more consistently profitable!

How high of a win rate would you need if you lost twice as much as you gained on your losers?"

Does someone understand what the strategy is, is it based on some indicator, how does it determine when exactly to buy and sell and win almost every time? I made screenshots of a few of the trades and marked with blue the entries and exits, the first 2 Tradingview screenshots are for buying, and the other 2 for selling. I really wanted to copytrade this strategy but they don't allow it for EU customers. But now it will be even better if we can understand what exactly this strategy is based on.

Thanks in advance for any help and suggestions!

I trade futures mostly nasdaq i have a account with amp I started with $250 yesterday and brought it to $1065 after 4 trades and called it a day. Today I decided to go against all my rules and trade e mini nasdaq with 2 contracts first trade I made $300 second trade I made $400 then I was looking for one more trade for the day but I decide to go for a home run I’m up 750 for the day already and decide to trade 3 contracts of e min nasdaq targeting $2900 profit it got all the way up to $2400 I took my stop loss off yea I know stupid and gambling went all the way down and blew my whole account lesson stick to rules you will never be profitable gambling now I’m going to take 3 weeks off 😔

I”m also copying this account. Discovered this account a month ago and put a amount in the copytrading with a result of 58% till now. Still a little bit nervous because a crash is always possible.. have seen it on 3 other accounts that a copy🫠

aaaand its gone.

[removed]

Ive been copying this for few months, but it looks like its about to crash and burn today. Ive set my stop to equity today so major dramas in case it blows up. Fun while it lasted..

I'm also wondering what he uses. Maybe a good grid system? This would explain the insane equity / balance dips. I'm trying to code something similar as a cBot and the equity looks quite the same.

Daytrading,Is this a valid retest?,"Guys

I am just learning and after playing with all kinds of indicators.  I am now actually really enjoying trying to predict moves using price action and support/resistance.

Was watching the EURUSD today looking for a trade entry point.  Does the entry point I marked on my chart look like a genuine restest and is it an obvious entry point?

Should I have anticipated the earlier price drop around 1.08950 and the swing back up around 1.08700 as entry points?

Any general tips or advice on this play and chart is welcome.  thanks

I don't trade support and resistance but I would have played this by marking out my support zone. Which is look like you marked the high but not the zone. Then when I think it is going to flip I would go on the 1min chart and look to see how price is behaving. For example if on the 1min I see strong bearish candles with high volume I am not going to take a buy. If I see that price is clearly struggling to continue on downwards then I will enter a buy position.

Sort of, but not a typical one. If I was day trading I’d wait for it to move away more and then retest in a much more obvious way. Sometimes it doesn’t do that, but if you’re a retest trader then you’ll occasionally miss those moves that don’t retest, or don’t retest to the area you’re waiting on.

It's a retest of the 109.00 resistance.  If you look to the left 109.00 is the most recent resistance,  price consolidated and then moved down couldn't break 109. It depends on how you trade how you would mark it. That's why some do lines some do zones, it depends on your eye. Some would start where you have your line and draw a zone down to 109. One of the ways I trade I look at the most recent resistance as the most valid but you have to be aware of the other resistance areas on your chart. By the way there is not a right or wrong answer, it all about what you see and how you trade. Trade what works for you!

So where would you mark the support Zone mate? cheers

Thanks man. Yeah you are correct. I should have marked a res line at 109. That would have made this look like a solid retest. Think I’m gonna watch a few forex pairs this week, mark R/S and paper trade breaks and retests.  Cheers"

Gold successfully broke and closed above a key horizontal daily resistance yesterday.

Our next strong resistance is based on the All Time High.

USDJPY is trading in a bullish trend.

After the price set a new higher high, we see quite an extended consolidation

within a horizontal range.

150.9 is the resistance of the range.

If the market breaks and closes above that on a daily,

we can anticipate a trend-following movement.

Next resistance will be 151.6

Alternatively, a bearish breakout of the support of the range

may trigger a bearish continuation.

Thursday ,Feb 29th we made a clear and obvious idm (putting in a swing point to sweep before my Orderblocks) which validated at least my orderblock.

So for about six or seven months, I’ve been toying around with previous daily high and previous daily low levels and basically I just play off of those so when it gets broken in more of an efficient, tight price action, usually the next day it retrace is within the previous daily level specifically to the previous daily open (if the context is right on daily and weekly) it’s usually an order block somewhere in there on the four hour or two hour time frame I can’t tell you exactly how I found that out just literal market experience. No one ever told me that on YouTube.. & the obs aren’t always at the PDO but somewhere near there if you know that plus how to spot them in general I can get beauties like this the whole way.

I was actually a bit surprised by that outcome with the level highs, but good to be surprised. I like the d2 on occasion also. Lovely simple logical trade.

I’ve found Al Brooks’ phase breakdown to serve me best. One of the things he says is that when price enters a range like we see here, it can break out in either direction. So for me, I just wait for it to show direction and then enter on confirmation.

Look left, set your supply and demand areas, wait for a break and retrace and rejection. Set an RvR at 2 to 1 minimum. Once a supply or demand area breaks, you can wait for the retrace and rejection. Or just wait for a retrace back to supply and demand and rejection. It's pretty effective and doesn't require any indicators. As long as you can see the bigger picture. I use the 15m because I can see the forest not just the trees. But I use an area that's been rejected 3 times at least to set my s/d. Try it out. You may like it.

Daytrading,12/2/24 Mock Trade/Recap,"If it's allowed, I'm gonna start posting some of my trades here and break them down to get feedback from you guys. This isn't meant to be educational for anyone because I have not been profitable consistently enough, long enough to warrant anyone taking what I say as gospel. Just trying to keep myself accountable and be more active in the community. Here's the trade I mocked up Monday morning, and I'll explain in depth my though process below it:

[Some prefaces: I am paper trading with an account size of $50k to get accustomed to winning\/losing the amount of money I would with a $50k topstep account, which is my current goal. Now here's my trade recap and thought process: Monday morning I still had a bullish bias on the S&P. Every day that I trade I go out to daily and weekly time frames and work my way down identifying trends to decide my bias for the day. For example if I have a bullish high time-frame bias, I will look for buys only \(I'm not trying to catch a reversal or trade against the trend\). Next I will block off Asian session start and finish and look to see if there were any significant price levels that the New York session might want to push to to sweep liquidity. In this specific case, I was looking for an Asian session low for the New York session to push down towards, sweep, and move up from. This low is indicated by the yellow line at \~5022. Once NY opened and reached that price, it triggered the first confluence for my trade. My hypothesis was that liquidity has been swept, and price now has the legs to continue up. The next confluence I look for in my strategy is for a fair-value gap to form. To me, this confirms price's \\""intentions\\"" of moving up. I look for these FVG's on the 15 minute time frame, as I have found them to be more valid than lower time-frame FVG's. In this case there was a FVG, however very small, so I went down to the 5 min to get a better look. The white box is the FVG I marked. Once I see this form, I am looking for price to retrace to this level. A wick below the FVG is ok, as long as a candle doesn't close below. In this case, these conditions are met, however I am still not ready for entry. My last confluence is a break of structure above the the previous relative high above the FVG. I understand that waiting this long might decrease the amount of profit I can take, but it has proven beneficial for my win-rate. The second yellow line, above the FVG is where I would have looked to enter \(\~5028\). The close of that candle marked a break of structure to the upside, and I am now in the trade. As for risk management, There weren't any prior significant price levels to target so I set my take profit as two times the height of my stop loss, which I set just below the level I marked as the liquidity sweep. With an account size of $50k, a standard position size for me is 1&#37;, so I entered with $500, and took profit at $1,000. Thanks for reading through, if you have any comments or criticisms, please let me know. I'm currently a full-time college student so I can't trade consistently every day, but I have stuck with this strategy for a while and it seems to work.](https://preview.redd.it/7uycieg8shic1.png?width=2162&format=png&auto=webp&s=062b2b19fafeef6d12e89ab0743fb2d2884b7eda)",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1aqgbhv/12224_mock_traderecap/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1aqgbhv/12224_mock_traderecap/,1,0,2024-02-14 06:26:29,Which_Technician_614,

Daytrading,How long is a FVG valid?,"I'm currently backtesting my strategy, but hindsight is 20/20 so I'd like to hear from anyone that trades similarly or has more experience in the market. The first confluence I look for is a fair value gap that price could retrace to before continuing in the direction of my daily bias. Today I was bullish on the S&P (I know there was news, I didn't trade but am still practicing reading price action). My question is, is this fair value gap from last week still a valid confluence? How long can something like this be relevant to the price action? A buy out of this FVG would have won, but I'm trying to evaluate this without the benefit of hindsight. Could I really have used a FVG from last week as confluence or was this movement just a coincidence? Does that spike down in the middle invalidate the FVG? For context, I would have looked on a lower time frame for a break of structure after the right-most test of the FVG.

I agree that there needs to be more confluence for there to be grounds for a trade, but i guess I’m just asking, would you say in your opinion that the FVG gets invalidated by that middle dip? Or would you still play that gap as a valid gap?

I suppose those are valid FVG’s but I just wasn’t looking to trade off of them because my daily bias was bullish

Never been a direct subscriber to ICT. I’m sure some of the things I’ve learned from others may also happen to be taught by ICT but I don’t copy trade his strategy or anything

Yes it's invalid after it got run through. At least that's how I'd treat it.

from what little i know after checking out ICT strategy, price moves to different areas of liquidity (volume imbalance, FVG, sellside/buyside liquidity etc), and so once that FVG is used, it’s done. that’s just what i’ve noticed, but disclaimer: i don’t trade ICT strategy, i attempted to understand the concepts

That makes sense to me, thanks for your input. I guess that would mean that what I had charted out here isn’t really a valid movement, just a coincidence"

Also, for day trading you can still make a ton of $ in a ""range or consolidation"" 

You will also find that if you look right to your chart the last swing high in your consolidation is also resistance on the move down on a retest to get short. 

This sucks to hear, but everyone has different interpretations of price action because everyone has different objectives. Some take swing trades, some take 30 second trades.  Also varies on the timeframe you are trading. This is why trading takes so long to learn because only you can interpret it in your own way that you find useful in your system. What you call consolidation to another is not, etc.

I'd consider that to be a trading range. It's too wide and over too many hours. It could have broken out and trended or gone into a new range at any time. It's only obvious after the fact.

To me consolidation is a move, going sideways for a little and then either continuation of the trend or a reversal.

I consider stock market one of the modern marvels. Depending on your time frame, consolidation could be happen in ticks, minutes, hours or days... You can see consolidations in the microscopic levels if you zoom all the way in, and if you zoom all the way out, you can see consolidation in daily/weekly levels. So yes, that's consolidation depending on which time frame you are looking at. If you zoom all the way out to weekly level, the whole screenshot could be part of the consolidation. It's actually quite mind blowing. It's like recursion inside recursion.

There is build up liquidity

i found it easier to rename ""consolidation"" to ""gathering interest"" and it all made alot more sense for me. yes though.

Yes if price is trapped between a swing high or swing low for a given amount of time, it’s like consolidating. It may not appear so on a smaller time frame, but on a larger one yes.

Too me thats consolidation.. I see a bunch of buyer and sellers opinions

It depends, whole picture is still a downtrend, but if your positions start and end within the red box then yes it was kind of consolidating.

Daytrading,"Cant I just input the amount of $ I want to invest, instead of having to put in how much ""units""?"," 

Hey,

Quick question.

I've been using Tradingview for a while, but via my broker's website. Tradingview operates slightly different there. There it lets me simply imput the amount of money I want to invest in something.

I decided to move to another broker (OANDA) which allowes me to use the charts on Tradingviews own website, which also allows me way more options and indicators, which weren't available to me when I was using my previous broker.

One thing I'm currently struggling with is the thing described above.

Can't I simply just say I want to spend $1000 on (lets say for example) bitcoin and simply click on buy? Or does it need to be ""units""?

Every coin has different units. Ideally, I just want to be able to put in the amount of $ I want to invest in it instead of having to figure out the units each time I want to invest in something. Is this possible?

Fidelity allows quantity or dollar amounts. For dollar amounts it usually ends up being a fractional or ends in a fractional share.

When you open the order ticket, you can type in what dollar amount you want to risk, and it’ll automatically adjust the size. But, you need to have the stop loss set before you can do that, check the box for that and enter the price you want your SL at. Then put in the dollar amount you want to risk at the top next to the trade size

That's not how trading works with any asset class. You need to specify the amount of units. Units meaning lots, shares, contracts, pips whatever. You need to do the calculating to determine how many units cost x amount of dollars. 

Some platforms do the math for you. In tradingview if you use the bracket ordering system it helps with that alittle

Indeed, my previous broker, too. Problem just was I kept on being logged out of their system too much during trades, and a lot of tradingview features were missing. No replay, no extra indicators and more.

Thanks. I'm learning bit by bit.  


I did as you said, checked the SL and TP boxes, and also entered the value I'd like to risk.  


I'm using a papertrading account, and have set my equity to 1000. When I enter 20 dollar risk in the buy order, the units for bitcoin become 0.3418.  


Then in the trade order section I see the trade value is 14,702 dollars. I don't understand this. What am I doing wrong? How is it letting me buy 0,3418 BTC?  


I have risk set to 2% and reward to 4%.  


Thank you kindly!

Thanks!  


Can you maybe help me clarify something for me?  


1 unit = 1 bitcoin, for example?  


So, lets say I have $1000. I'd have to devide that by the price of bitcoin of this exact moment, and that will be my unit value?  


I do indeed see ""order info"" underneath the order form and it shows me the dollar amount. Thanks.  


How can I make this process more effecient when scalping in your opinion?  


Thanks again!

Not necessarily true, IBKR for example will let you put a dollar amount (like $1000 into Apple) and it will automatically grab as many wholes shares + fractional shares as the dollar amount allows for.

It might be that it’s showing the trade’s “notional value”, which is the full value of the size you’re wielding. It’s not how much is required, that’s why we trade with leverage, it allows us to only need a % of the trade’s full value to trade it, which is called margin.

Keep in mind that TradingView’s paper trading does not account for margin requirements, as this varies by broker and so it can’t know what the margin would be. This means that it may let you enter trades that you may not be able to enter if you were trading live with a broker. It depends.

So, it got you in with 0.3418 BTC as that’s the size that’s needed with the SL you’ve set in order to risk $20. 

Whether or not you’d be able to place that exact trade depends on your broker’s leverage. I don’t know what typical leverage is for crypto, but let’s say it’s 5:1, or 20%. If it was, then the margin required would be:

$14,702 * 0.2 = $2,940.40 required. So if the leverage was 5:1, you wouldn’t be able to place that trade with a $1,000 account. If you find out what your leverage would be, and you see that the required margin is too high, then you either need to size down, or use a bigger SL. A bigger SL will require less size for the same $ risk. A SL that’s too tight can make the margin required skyrocket."

I am trying to figure out the distinction between my own errors and the errors of TV/broker integration. Order was placed as marked by the long position tool.

Sorry about that. I think a lot of people agree that limit orders are good for taking profit, but for entry, buy stop orders (where a market order is triggered after reaching a certain point) might work better for you

Your tried placing a limit order where the green arrow is at the bottom and we’re trying to sell at the red arrow up top?

I don’t think you can really trust the buy at the green arrow. Maybe the green candle after it when it breaks the ema. Then sell when it’s overextended

Other trades will come

Panda demo on trading view the spreads are fucking crazy and I enter trades on the 1H so it’s probably the spread

what's the general consensus on TV's integration features? Is it only that people that hate it post about it, or is it truly problematic for most of the population?

Daytrading,How much is 1 unit,"I have been paper trading for a while and have been thinking of putting real money in the stock price here shown is 4,796 is 1 unit worth 4,796 or how does that stuff work?",https://i.redd.it/czbxscuc0qbc1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/193qc6h/how_much_is_1_unit/,0,13,2024-01-11 02:17:39,Ok-Cryptographer579,"Indices are 1:1.

Your account will need indices activated.

I recommend you learn at baby pips first. I’m not familiar with index CFDs so I’m not sure how they calculate/value the units for that

Oanda mobile app will calculate and show you price per pip. For me 1 unit is 1.33 sgd per pip for spx500usd

When you say 1:1 what do you mean by that?

Yeah I’ll try that for sure ive had some trouble finding info on this subject

Oh ok I see thanks and you use oanda to trade spx500usd? When I tried I could only do forex and I couldn’t find the spx

One unit would be one contract of the underlying asset, in this case SPX. I think Oanda offers 9:1 leverage on that asset so you can do the math from there

Here’s a pic showing two ways to take profit that I think are more adaptive to current conditions. 3x the balance area and second trend line breaks. The dotted horizontal lines are showing a balance area with a range of 0.384. 0.384 x 3 = 1.152. The solid horizontal lines are showing the low of the balance area plus 1.152 and the high of the balance area minus 1.152. See how price respected that 183.05 point? The other method is drawing two trend lines, one using the initial highs of the downtrend (or the initial lows of the uptrend), and the second using the high of the first notable pullback in the downtrend (or the low of the first notable pullback in the uptrend). The break of the second line can be a good take profit point, although in this case the balance area one would’ve been more profitable. Sorry if this is confusing. I know you said you’re a beginner. But try to keep this stuff in mind it can serve you in the future

thx for helping cuz it always suxked how it never hits my tp or takes days to do so

No problem. Yeah that’s frustrating. People like to set fixed take profits, but flexibility helps. Speaking of fixed, I believe at least part of the reason that 3x one works is because it would be like a 1:2 RR ratio from the closer end of the balance area (breakout point) or 1:3 RR ratio from the farther end (accumulation/distribution zone). 1:2 and 1:3 from that area makes sense"

Daytrading,need help testing this simple strategy on tradingview or other automatic test,"hello guys, i would like to test this simple strategy in an automated way but i know nothing about programming or pine or whatever.

i would really appreciate if someone wanted to help me and share the result of the backtest, the strategy is very simple so if you know how to program it should take very little time.

Strategy rules:

1. 1 trade per day on nasdaq100 future/cfd chart  (tradingview ticker NAS100 provided by OANDA)
2. 15 minutes before NY open, if price is below ema 21 on the 4h timeframe we enter short, if its above we enter long
3. TP of +80 pips, SL of -80 pips , so RR 1

i'd like to know the winrate of such strategy over say 1 year (the more data you can use the better)

we can consider this with zero fees and zero spread, as that i can manually add later based on the number of trades used in the backtest.

if anyone can run this test i would really appreciate it, thanks <3

its probably unprofitable once you consider fees but still what i want to know is if ""following the trend"" will give an actual statistical edge or if the result is more around 50% wr.

Good trade but of all the markets to trade you chose audnzd, really?

So there was a 4h confirmed downtrend a 1hr confirmed downtrend and you entered counter trend had your TP wait above first resis and caught an impulsive move up  past resis without and structure being created (new HL) and top ticked it for a 3:1? And you entered mid 1hr candle?

Seems a bit suspect my man. More context may help though perhaps I'm missing something

I don’t trade FOMC days volume and volatility are shit

I am not, so I have to read the structure. I could tell before the open that today would be bullish. At that point it is a matter of finding the best entry. The early drop is a gift, providing a great entry opportunity.

Having said that, I still flubbed it somewhat. My average entry is 15143. Not great but good enough. The first target exit was over 100.00 pts. The rest is unknown. We'll see.

You can look out for support and resistance on your trading timeframe (which appears to be the 5min), but I would recommend trades based off higher timeframe levels that you trade on the 5min. 

I also trade the 5min chart, and use the 1hr chart to find key levels to trade off of, then place my trades on the 5min. Even a small bounce on a higher timeframe came be a significant move on a lower timeframe

Edit: Also, yes to answer your question it looks like you did a good job of identifying levels on your pic. Just do the same thing on a higher timeframe (1hr or maybe 4hr as a suggestion) and then zoom into the 5min to look for trades at those levels.

This is a great video based on what you’re doing and your conversation with /u/altered_reality1

It looks like the price punched right through both your supply and demand zones, which invalidates them both

Nice trap there. And yes the zones are precise.

So you mean that I have to identify resistance and support levels on a higher frame 1h or 4h and then get back to the 5min frame to place my trades

A good example was one Friday, NQ did not make lower lows at one point and ES did, signifying strength in NQ. The play would be to find a long entry and a draw on liquidity on NQ, and take that trade. Conversely, if NQ made higher highs and ES didn’t, you could look for short entries on ES to a draw on liquidity.

Divergence of what? I heard about RSI divergence or MACD divergence. Normally I draw it on 1H at least and if it happens at 4H support/ resistance and or supply/ demand zones, its more likely to happen.

thank you, did i mark it up properly? this was the 15m friday new york session for both spx500 and nas100, i saw both divergences and technically both played out, just not sure if thats the proper way to go about it

As far as I can tell. SMTs should, like you said, not be used as the primary reason for entry, or even the secondary reason. It should be a minor confluence, helping with bias. But I would see that as basically one big SMT, with the S&P making higher highs and higher lows and the other index making both lower lows and lower highs."

No one is 'stop hunting' your 50$ trade.

No one is hunting your stops..if your stops are getting hit on a regular basis..they are too close for the market volatility. Orders are being pulled constantly…so why would they try to move the market to the tune of millions and million of dollars of potential losses to get your little 10 lot stop loss.

Spread is 15 pips on USDZAR, which made my 25 pip stop loss get hit easily.

Should I increase the stop so I can have a fair fight pr should I just stay safe? (The market went as I predicted after sl hit)

Sometimes both sellers and buyers’ SL are hunted before the trend resumes. I have seen it way too often to be random. Now I can realize that pattern and have had some winning trades because of it. Even on H4 or D1 tf, you can see those liquidity grabs before price shoots up or plunges. Its a zero sum game, where else can market makers make money from if not smaller ínstitution and retail traders?

I believe in that theory and OP has stats to prove that. With enough money, anyone can move the market how they want. Also, they do know where people place their SLs

How can you know when an institution is looking for stops?

Sorry I can't impress you with a magic wand that shows the precise trajectory of future price movement. Oanda order book represents generalized sentiment of those who are normally losing money to institutions

Institutions do trade on such a large scale though that they can’t just get in and out of there trades anywhere. They need to move the money into areas where there is enough sellers/buyers on the other side. There has been institutions caught up in legal action in the past for working together to do such things.

Personally, I wouldn't trade USDZAR as it is an exotic pair. Exotics have many irrational moves due to low liquidity and spread is bad. Why do you need exotics, mate?

But institutions also don't win every trade. Who do institutions lose to?"

2. Solid , shudve used much tighter stop once trade rentered range.
3. Bad. Trading against an unbroken UTL is going to fuk u every time.

I specialize in trendline trading

yeah, don't go short in an uptrend

1st trade is good. Bull flag
2nd trade is bad. It is a bullish day as it keeps making higher high and trending upward started with a solid bull flag. It never breaks the low. Wouldn't short unless for quick small scalp.
3rd trade will have to wait for consolidation or a strong bearish reversal momentum before consider shorting. The picture shows still in an uptrend. Wouldn't short it.

Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend you master going long before you start trying to short. TOO many issues to list why your short trades aren’t going to work with your current strat but the gist of mastering long first is your gains are uncapped/inversely a short position has unlimited loss potential in theory. 

Even the best/perfect short only has a 100% gain potential unless you’re trading options, even then the upside has more room for gain. Grated you’re using proper risk management but you will be EXTREMELY surprised what happens when you trade a real money account and all of a sudden go into monkey tilt revenge trade mode and refuse to cut your position at your SL because “you know you’re right”. 

Pay more attention to price action and how the market is reacting than to standard bull/bear flags.

What time zone are you in?

Great one, please continue sharing, mush to learn here ;)

I would have other indicators, at least volume. IMO, price action trading with indicators gives much more insight into the action.

What do you classify as a broken UTL? (Also what is UTL, I’m guessing under trendline?)

Good self awareness man, the market really is just a waiting game most of the time

I feel your pain - having the same issue with bias based on open holdings … if i can stop that, i can make so much more $$🙄

Being married to a bias is the biggest challenge when trading. You need to be able to Flip The Switch.

 It's not what you think should happen, it's what is happening in front of your eyes. 

Most traders simply can't go from a Short position to a Long position. While the pro do it effortlessly.

You’re not alone. Paper trading and trading with real money are two entirely different challenges. I have a 70% win rate in paper and back testing, but my win rate drops to 40% when trading for real thanks to all the emotions that don’t come up in paper. And I account for potential slippage when I trade with paper as well.

> went back to live paper trading for last two days

Damn, that's one slick anti-/u/UtilizingTheta move.

Paper trading have error correction factor n real trading is unforgiving

Playing video games daily helps keep emotion out of my trading (amongst other things). Win or learn. Can’t win every game! Learn and move on. If you believe you made the right choice, it’s out of your hands after the entry, let the market do what it does. All you have to control is your stop-loss and risk management. Being wrong is not a death sentence and being correct once does not guarantee consistent success. Keep improving and it’ll all fall into place one day.

If you feel biased you could put a hedge on your position and make it delta neutral till you feel you actually have strong movement in direction.

If you want an easier way to think about it, it's just a double bottom. The second touch is a bit higher but it looks the same. Not a bad thing to wait for that second green candle though so you can see that buyers were present

I double dare you to take nothing but that set up 20 times without touching it.

I think the first partial mid way was key. That could have been a triple top reversal back down the range. Anything can happen.

Well done but breaking your rules to win is not good thing , you’ll slowly get used to being rewarded for lacking discipline. Slippery slope

Forex market This time of day is notorious for having very low volume. See how the volume drops right when your order was executed? This is also why it became very volatile. This means there will be a very high spread. (See number between red block and blue block. That’s the difference between the ask and bid. Currently your pic is showing 3.5 pips) the spread is how much commission the broker takes. So if the spread is 10 pips it automatically adds the spread (commission) to your break even price.  This means if your planning to take profit at 5 pips and the spread was 5 pips, you broke even. Don’t trade at this hour and don’t place a trade until you have considered how much commission it will cost you.  I have a checklist of things that have to be considered or addressed before any order is placed. I hope you are trading with a paper account..  keep asking questions and don’t get discouraged.

Can you at least put the image in the correct orientation? Using screenshot instead of taking a pic using your mobile device is even better.

You enetered the trade, but the “spread” is as low as the order…

Look at it this way, there are 3 lines on the chart, on higher than the middle and one lower… price is the middle, but the spread is the higher and lower one…

When you enter, your order will be placed at the outer lines, not the actual price line… when the markets are closed, the spreads will be considerably wider then when the market is open…

I like to say that your order will be placed at which ever is best favorable to the broker. That is their profit/risk for opening the trade for you. When you “buy” (long) you would have been filled at the higher line, when you “sell” (short) you will be filled at the lower line…


Edit: your chart doesn’t have the 3 lines… you need to put the bid/ask lines in your chart, this will simplify this idea…

Edit: on Tradingview as you’re using, go to settings, symbol, check mark the Bid/Ask option.

Often when you trade Forex with leverage you are trading CFDs rather than spot. Idk if that's the case here but if it is then you should know that because CFDs are a bet with the broker, they are able to decide to a degree what price they will make that bet at. To put things in their favour the price you can sell at is always lower than the price you can buy at. Depending on the pair you might have a wider spread which is what I think is happening here, you got filled at the best price the broker would offer, not the spot or 'real' price. Likewise the best price the broker will close the position at is far above what you sold it at. Not to be a dick but you should know this before you're down 700$, trade sim until you have a working strategy with a positive expectancy

Looks like you put a market order and it got filled in the bid-ask spread

I don’t want to sound rude here but why are people trading when they clearly don’t have an understading of why certain things are happening.

We all started somewhere.

The only way to learn to trade is to trade.
OP is smartly trading paper.

Better to learn you need to consider the bid/ask spread before trading with real money.

Eventually OP will have a checklist before entering a trade that include determining the maximum loss of the trade.

Hi everyone, I have a winning strategy that works perfectly with me because i didn't look for any model and understood the markets by my own few years ago. I implemented it with some basic concepts and i was wondering if it has a name and if it's something common. Took me years to get it by myself so there's how it works:

\- I trade on XAUUSD  
\- Overlap between London and NY  
\- Top down analysis D - H4 - H1 - 30  
\- looking for 15min entry  
\- Identifying Support levels / Resistances  
\- Once i see if its bearish/bullish for the day i wait for a correction then enter long/short  
\- I use FIBO for TP and SL  
\- I enter after confirmations like Engulfing candlestick / liquidity sweep / BOS / FVG's and few more

Is there a name for that type of trading ?? I have a lot of traders i know that are asking me how i trade and i never new if it has a name and already exists ( for example someone that says he's trading ICT or whatever)

I’d call it a reversal strategy.

Take the loss and learn. It could go back up or it could go much lower. Now you're gambling. Hope isn't a trading strategy. Trust me I've been there.

Rule 2, follow rule 1 .

Rule 3 , follow rule 2.

From my experience when I’m like thinking and hoping the price will do something, instead of waiting for a high probability setup, that’s when I have losing trade. We have to react to price and not predict. By being long you not just lost a long but also missed out on a short. So it’s a double edge sword. I like to write some explanation after every win or loss with like a lesson of the trade and save the screenshots. Than you look through them from time to time, and next time something same happens you will go short. Try to see the gaps as just a large trend bar. It can get recovered, but it can just as well be the spike breakout that start an all day trend. Good luck

Bro, that's really good for you to close the trade. Not being stubborn could make you going longer in this journey

Just saw your post, man, and sorry to hear about that 9% hit. Gotta say, not setting a stop loss is a common rookie mistake, but you’re not alone – everyone learns this way early on. Gap fills aren’t guaranteed, so try not to rely on assumptions; always have a clear plan with risk management in place.

Before taking trades, practice having defined stop-loss and profit targets, and don’t trade on impulse. If you’re looking for more guidance, I’d suggest checking in with our community on Discord or making an appointment with my friend Daniel for solid advice. Let me know if you’d like more details!

I thought, I figured, I didn’t set up a stop loss,… fomo,greed, gambling(a recipe for disaster) get out of that thing fast before I whoop you!

It's your trading account. Do what you feel is best. The gap will fill, one day. But is it worth your entire account balance to find out? No.

You should be risking 1-2% of your balance at maximum. Any trade you take you should be thinking about your stop loss before even thinking about TP targets. Without a defined logical stop loss area, the trade should never have been placed."

Who knows. Be prepared for such movements. No matter how close you watch the news, there will be times you will catch such drops with long-positions. 😁

Ah i see that, do these drops happen the exact moment that those news article is released? or it it something that comes out earlier that i can watch before hand to predict such drops?

Yes pretty much exactly when it drops. You do not want to try and predict these drops, that would be gambling. When you see CPI, PPI, FOMC, or any red folder you should be weary that the trading conditions might be extremely volatile and unpredictable. Make sure you use a stop loss if you decide to do it anyway.

Also, it is important you know how news affects pairs. The first currency in the pair will be affected in alignment with the news data (ex. If CPI was bad for GBP then price falls). However, say you are trading GBP/JPY and JPY has news that is positive for its currency, that will make GBP/JPY fall. This is because GBP is being traded against JPY.

Thank you for the insight, i looked at some details about that CPI on forex factory and it said that it drops monthly and usually drops 16 days after the month ends, which would line up with todays date, something I can look at/prepare for? Although it also says next release is Nov 20 so idk"

Trading,The interesting world of Japanese FX brokers.,"Hello there!

Well since I live in Japan I thought it might be interesting for some people to learn a bit about how a very particular but fairly big FX market functions for retail traders. First of all here in Japan, you have to choose between the domestic brokers which I'll talk about because they're quite interesting compared to brokers you see around online, and the ""overseas"" broker which are allowed but barely (it's more like tolerated). In fact, many brokers are not available to Japan residents because they don't want to potentially deal with Japanese authorities. The ones that do, (there are like a dozen I think?) are often regulated in Seychelles or Mauritius like XMTrading, ICMarkets Global, HFM etc. So we still have the choice, unlike US traders who are banned everywhere unfortunately. Few foreign brokers try to open up shop domestically. Notable names are Saxo Bank, Forex.com, Oanda and Dukascopy however.  
Anyway, I want to provide a glimpse into purely Japanese FX brokers because they offer trading conditions that might make your jaw drop, especially on YEN pairs.  


So we have big names like GMO, Minna no FX, Rakuten (which is also present in Australia), DMM or even LINE (yes the message application). They actually advertise fairly aggressively. I always hear about DMM FX or CFD in local convenience stores for example. Regulation is pretty tight, however and leverage is low (I think it's max 1:25 on major pairs). Landing on their home page is advertising no commissions whatsoever. OK so you might think that spreads are at least like 0.9 pips right?? Well no. USD/JPY notably is often advertised as having 0.2 pip only! Same (0.2) for the highly exotic MXN/JPY who rose in popularity due to the carry trade, something you'll NEVER find anywhere else... And the carry trade is often highly advertised, ""We have the best swaps!"" they say. This is because they cater to the famous ""Mrs Watanabe"" traders who just carry trade -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Watanabe  
Also one peculiar thing is that they often do not have Metatrader and rely on their own platforms. Some do advertise Metatrader though or more recently, tradingview.  
Another curious thing is Minna no FX for example advertising ""BIG lots up to 300 allowed""! Damn, some people must be balling!   Some even have really low spreads on EUR/USD or AUD/USD like 0.3. It's really surprising for a 0 commission account. Who knows, maybe it would be interesting for day trading or even scalping as this would be very very low cost.
I am not sure if those domestic FX brokers are market makers, STP or ECN. This is not really something they advertise but the fact that they're regulated in Japan make them extremely safe, generally speaking.

There you go, a glimpse into the local FX offering. I'm sure those are trading conditions that aren't found anywhere else tbh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1frb30t/the_interesting_world_of_japanese_fx_brokers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1frb30t/the_interesting_world_of_japanese_fx_brokers/,7,7,2024-09-28 10:08:41,romjpn,"This looks like a newbie/general question that we've covered in our [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/wiki/index) - Have a look at the contents listed, it's updated weekly!

Hi, I don't live in Japan, but just out of curiosity, could you tell me something about the Fintokey prop company? It was born from the Purple Trading broker and after Japan, they are expanding their business in Italy and Eastern Europe. They claim to be very popular in Japan but it is difficult for me to find reviews from Japanese users. Thanks

[removed]

Honestly it's hard for me to say anything because you literally just made me discover them. I can't find anything blatantly bad about them when taking a look at what is said on X from a few Japanese users.  
Their instant accounts are cool though.

The COVID years were absolutely insane for this strategy, especially MXN/JPY longs but right now the cycle is turning back into JPY strength so it's time to downsize the position or close all of them.

Got it, thanks for your reply"

No, not in the US. Things like gold, oil, indices etc are not allowed on Forex brokers because where you’ve seen them on these brokers they’re CFDs, and CFDs aren’t allowed in the US. Forex brokers here only offer spot Forex trading, ie real Forex trading.

If you want to trade gold, oil, indices, etc then you have to trade futures with a futures broker like AMP, Tradovate, etc. 

Some CFD to futures symbol conversions are: Gold/XAUUSD = GC or MGC, Oil/USOIL = CL or MCL, US100/NAS100 = NQ or MNQ, US500/SPX500 = ES or MES, US30/DJI30 = YM or MYM (M stands for micro, ie the smaller contracts)

Trading,Minimizing financing costs trading cfd,"Hi,

If trading index’s, why not use a broker that gives you access to futures and move away from CFD’s and their nuances.

What are your financing costs as a percentage of your profits? 

Generally speaking, I would not think that financing costs/swaps or commissions would significantly 'eat away' the profits of a profitable system with a legitimate edge.

Anyone else? :$

eh. trade futures???

My profit over 3 years with all costs included is 25% and without financing costs(I believe its just financing) it would have been 12% more. 

I really feel this can be lowered? Should I switch over from cfds?

Thanks for your response btw

There are certainly methods to minimise financing costs, which will ultimately depend on your trading strategy - key considerations will include average holding time, whether you hold through the triple-swap roll-over, if your portfolio is predominantly long/short, etc. 

That being said, how much time and effort are you putting into this system/portfolio? At ~8.33% per annum - on a leveraged cfd portfolio - you might be better off buying and holding the  index (particularly if you are not utilising the leverage provided by your broker) or an ETF, which will likely match your current returns, if not exceed them (for instance, research the S&P500 historical benchmark), with lower fees (than the 32% you have paid over the past three years).

32%? 

And it’s very little effort, 1 min a day or so. But the way towards this method was long tho :-p but very fun to watch myself going from losses to breakeven to now in profit. Maybe the financing costs are a little skewed, because I’m counting from my current strategy that changed everything, I’ve been trading for a long time, financing costs are probably lower than I said, but still to high for my liking and the question still stands. 

Holding the index/etf doesnt cost anything?

I really like how my trading is going, but I feel there must be a way to cut costs, don’t think I want to abandon ship just yet ;))"
Trading,How do retail Forex broker 'spreads' come into play when I place an order? (Forex),"I understand that the spread is the difference between the current best BID price and the current best ASK price. But I don't understand how retail brokers add their own spreads.

Scenario, AUD/USD:

\- Current BID price: 0.6383  
\- Current ASK price: 0.6387  
\- So the spread is: 4

Maybe it's just building up enough juice to break through?

Or maybe the price of the gold doesn't change and the USD does?

the fact that gold is now making a break above 1904 does not mean that it will not go down to 1885 to skim liquidity.As I wrote before around 1900$ I expect manipulation.But so far we have not had a short signal !!!

I don't follow gold so I just checked. It had a wick up a couple hours ago which looks like a failure. But it hasn't broke down yet either.

USD has broke out so far today but the day is not over so it could end at a wick out as well. Needs another day. It does look strong though."
Trading,XAUUSD," 

Hello guys, I continue to be sick, but as you know money never sleeps or rests. This is gold 1H timeframe. We broke above the trendline with multiple green candles, but the bulls continue to be weak, unable to overcome the 1904 level. After seeing that the bulls have no intention to make a breakout and a shooting star followed I opened my short position (second picture). Now here the options are two .One is to continue the strong down trend by breaking 1885 and continue to 1870.The second option is to take the stops at the triple bottom below and then start a 4hr retest which will take us to 1955 prices. So far, the market sentiment continues to be bearish!

Trading,How do you back test your bot?,"Helly guy, I am new here, I am studying and implement a trading bot. I have a question about how do you back test your bot? This is the basic question but I want focus on these aspects

1. How long should the back test last?

Let say you have a bot that works well when back test since 2021 until now but not good since 2019 or 2020. Is this a good bot? Will we try to build a bot and back test that bot from time T in the past until now with T as long as possible.

2. Do you fixed spread when back test?

Spread will affect price you buy or sell, then how it should be handled when back test your strategy. I should used fixed spread or not while back test my strategy.

3. Can data to back test be used between markets?

For my case, I download data gold price from Oanda and back tests my strategy using python, when I finish, I can only trade on Exness (I don't have account to trade on Oanda for some reasons). If my bot works on Oanda, can I say it will work on Exness too? Can I use Oanda data to calculate the signal for buying, selling in Exness because I only have API to download data from Oanda.

Note: I know all these questions can be answered by trying but it's better to hear from someone who already tried it. Glad to hear from you sharing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/14ehi4h/how_do_you_back_test_your_bot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/14ehi4h/how_do_you_back_test_your_bot/,1,5,2023-06-20 17:34:52,AWiselyName,"/r/algoTrading old threads and wiki, 1000s of threads about this

I spent 3 years back testing it on several different exchanges and found that when I started forward testing it, my results were entirely different and not as predictable or profitable as the back tests show.

Since that lesson, I only use forward testing now but on multiple demo accounts so I can aggregate large amounts of data quickly to analyze the process.

I do backtesting on cleo.finance. There are 2 backtesting tools automated and manual. I mostly use automated. You create your bot and backtest it, there are some useful statistics and you can also replay your position history on the chart. Plus you can also include the transaction costs funding fees, commissions, and slippage."
Trading,What’s the reason most of you are failures at trading? And why do you keep doing it if you think 90% will never be profitable over time? Let me learn from your mistakes.,"I’m an amateur. I used a demo account for six months, watched hundreds of hours of videos and taken courses. Ive been growing my live account 10-25% a week for a few months simply doing what I’ve been taught and sticking to the rules. 

I trade forex CFD through oanda. 2-5 trades a day. 50:1 leverage. 

I’m waiting for something to change, waiting for failure because there are so many of you that say you’ve been trading for 10 years and you’re  breaking even. 

Why are you loosing? Are you getting greedy? Do you not have risk management plan ? How did you blow up your account? How did you loose so many trades in a row?

There’ve been times when I was doing so well for so long I severely cut my hours or even quit my day job, but then I have a few surprises and/or get greedy and trade on hood instead of signals. The only times I’ve lost a lot of money are times when I got too emotional and ignored all the sense my brain was trying to impress upon me. 

So yeah, got greedy and didn’t stick to rules. We’re emotional beings.

And congratulations on growing your account! It’s a beautiful thing when a plan comes together. If you’re doing well with what works for you, don’t fix what ain’t broken.

It’s all blowing smoke until you trade through a black swan event.

Risk management, FOMO, revenge trading, not sticking to rules. Thats why most fail. There are multiple of strategies that work, people just cant deal with the drawdowns and/or cant deal with the “I’m good at this! I should do MORE!” Thoughts. Get greedy, blow accounts.

The inability to change. Anyone can learn price action and technical analysis (seriously, simple concept you can teach a grade schooler) but fighting the urge to do something you know you shouldn’t is everybody’s struggle. You can’t teach discipline, you can only do it. (If that makes any sense).

Do you have any advice, what book to read or what videos to watch? I am just starting out with trading and want to really know what I'm doing before putting my money onto the line. Thanks in advance!

Ok ..great ! I have a question if you don't mind.
What education support did you use.?
What was the starting balance of you paper account?
Did you simulate a 2k or even a 1k acct?
Your doing great!
Thx

Most traders lack an edge. I use huge datasets and a systematic approach via Python to explore edges in mew strategies.

Psychology is important but meaningless without edge.

more than 90% wont be profitable never ever in their lives.
if you want to make money in the trading world, use a different approach - e.g: give servkces/products that traders use

why do people just assume the random number of 90%\~ failure rate? In reality, if you equate failure = never making more than minimum wage from pure trading, the actual failure rate is something more like **99%.**

The problem with the failure rate is that failed trades accumulate larger losses than successfuul ones. Meaning that realizing gains is a huuge barrier.

Eiher you sell too early or you hang on to winning positions until they pull back again.  
At least this is my experience.

Having the right discipline in both directions is not as easy as it sounds."
Trading,GOLD - 2023 Price Targets,"Hello Traders,

Here is my prediction for GOLD and its target levels for 2023.

First off, I believe GOLD will be one of the best performing assets in 2023. With GOLD being a safety play during economic hardship, and the strong possibility of a recession, we should see GOLD outperform the broader market like in past recessions.

So how high will GOLD go in 2023?

GOLD will likely make new All Time Highs in 2023, potentially as early as the end of the 1st quarter. We could potentially see the price of GOLD rise as much as 20% next year.

Keep in mind we will have pullbacks along the way as price hits resistance levels on the way up, with he most significant level being the prior highs at just over $2,000. We could potentially see price initially pullback sharply off the prior highs then consolidate for weeks before breaking out.

How to trade GOLD?

You will want to enter a GOLD position on a pullback into technical support, not when experiencing FOMO after a monster move. Be patient and wait for the right setup to occur. There will be many rejections at resistance on the way up, where price will have to pullback or consolidate before the next move up. These types of scenarios present the best opportunity for a wing trade in GOLD.

Thanks Everyone

Ask your broker on what they are basing the their marging interest rates. It could be Libor for example that changes all the time.

I have trading for the past 9 months it was all good. Until they change the rollover rate within a night. So all my holding position are now paying swap fee. 

My question was is it legal firm them to change from 1.4% to -5.40%. the Fed hasn't changed the interest rate yet. What is the underlying motive ? Uk Russia war ? But how ? It looks like they just roll the dice and switch the rate trapping most traders like now being on the wrong side."

1st year - $72 a day off 5 Pips = $18,792 + $3,477 (original balance) = $22,269

2nd year beginning balance $22,269 x 50 leverage = $1,113,450 = $556 (5 pips a day) x 261 days

= $145,116 + $22,269 (previous balance) = $167,385 

3rd year beginning balance of $167,385 x 50 leverage = $8,369,250 = $4,184 (5 pips a day) x 261 days = $1,092,024 + $167,385  (previous balance) = $1,259,409

Only way you’ll fail is if you quit

Do not think about compounding pips. 
Measure your stop loss and equate that to One percent (or 2 or 5, if you are a cowboy). That will dictate your leverage. On forex, one percent risk per trade will use approx 10 to 1 max leverage on most trades. Do the numbers.

Don't think about days on days. 

Just know, if you can do 3 percent a month, every month for five years and longer (that's 42 a year compounded monthly), you are a Bonafide star.

If you can do 6 percent a month, you are a Legend.

Never listen to morons who think a small acct grows faster. All accts are the same size, when you are talking about less then 25 million.

All the best.

It looks like you’re compounding yearly not daily... also 5 pips on $3,477*50=$86 not $72? Also doesn’t look like you’re factoring in leverage costs unless your 5 pips is net

Edit: also 50x leverage can go really wrong way really quickly

Wow. Tha'st the catch u'know. Just can't take demo trading lightly. I remember I practiced it for a long period(good 7-10 months approx)  too before going live.

I can start with 1k as well but since I already lost 2,5k I figure . I should accumulate more money so I can trade with 3k same as demo to certain degree with the same lots size.

Exactly, and this is were you learn. The emotional aspect of paper trading is sooooo different. I know guys going back to paper several times. So the first time you go live, keep in mind you're going to loose... Eventually

And also, you can't trade the ""cash value"" of cryptos sorry. Bitcoin futures aren't a thing so you have to trade the asset itself. Crypto exchanges make it easy and intuitive however.

It sounds like you want to trade crypto in the form of forex. I would suggest a forex.com account, and the MT4 platform. This allows BTC and XRP against USD. It does not allow for anything else, other than ethereum though, so if you want a full list of cryptos you are better off going the route of a crypto exchange.

It’s better to trade the cash value of bitcoin, and on a bitcoin exchange like Coinbase. You can earn rewards and it’s a delight to transfer money. Keep the traditional brokers (forex.com, CMC Markets, fxview) for forex trading. And if you want to really excel, concentrate only on 1 pair.

I'm sorry but bitcoin futures are DEFINITELY a thing

Thank you for the broker suggestion! I actually made a forex demo account about a month ago and it was one of the demos that I couldn’t figure out how to trade BTC against USD. Maybe this was because it was *just* a demo account? 

If I do take the route of a crypto exchange, would you happen to know if I am still able to trade the cash value or do I have to actually purchase and trade crypto itself?

This. Nearly all crypto exchanges have the option for futures trading. I use Binance personally. Never had any issues with them. It uses USDT though, so I guess technically you're not trading cash value.

Was it the MT4 platform account or the Web trader account? They should both have it, I personally have traded XRP/USD on my MT4 account. The demo account should have all the features of the live account

I see! So I’m just a little confused. Is what I’m trying to do here considered forex trading or futures trading?"

I traded with oanda they screwed me over and i closed the account.

The price will go through my stop loss and it didnt trigger, same with buy stop and sell stop orders.
There was all kind of shady stuff happening, im happy i left the spot forex and cfd world.

I've had this happen to me on crypto derivatives. It happens if you don't have enough available margin to open a position in another direction. Stop loss has to be reduce-only type, or else if you don't have enough margin to open such position, stop loss will be cancled.

I didnt try to reverse the position, just trying to close it you dont need margin to close a position.

Trading cfd and forex with oanda and interactive brokers was the most frustrating time in my trading carreer.

They will try to screw you over if you are profitable, if you are not profitable they will be happy to have you as a customer."

Investing,"PacWest, Western Alliance Lead Regional Bank Stock Rout","From bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/pacwest-western-alliance-lead-regional-bank-stock-rout

>PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp each slumped more than 25% Tuesday, leading a renewed selloff in regional lenders as investors continued to gauge the health of the industry after the second-largest US bank failure ever.

>Trading in shares of both banks were halted for volatility, amid the broader slide that took the KBW Regional Banking Index down as much as 6.1%, the most intraday since March 17. Comerica Inc. and Zions Bancorp. each fell more than 10%, while Charles Schwab Corp., the brokerage with a bank arm that’s come under pressure in the wake of the regional banking tumult, sank 5.3%. 

>The sector’s retreat comes a day after First Republic Bank’s seizure and sale to JPMorgan Chase & Co., and underscores investors’ ongoing concerns about competitors of the four banks that have collapsed since early March. The slide has now taken the regional banking gauge down 28% this year.

>JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was quick to proclaim the current leg of the banking crisis “over” during a conference call discussing his bank’s acquisition of First Republic on Monday. He recommended everyone “just take a deep breath” even as higher interest rates and stress on the commercial real estate industry pose a threat to the banking sector.

>“While FRC resolution is a good sign, we haven’t had a clear solution to the lack of confidence across regional banks and may need a more holistic response from regulators or the government,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Herman Chan said in a message.

>Western Alliance and PacWest are among a number of regional banks investors zeroed in after Silvergate Capital Corp., SVB Financial Group and Signature Bank collapsed in quick succession and demonstrated the threat posed to commercial lenders by asset-liability mismatches and uninsured deposits.

>But both companies posted earnings results in April that appeared to appease investors, with both firms indicating their deposit bases had stabilized or recovered after initial outflows in March.

>“It looks like JPMorgan’s deal for FRC gave us one day of calm for the banking sector. Regional banking stocks are still looking vulnerable until we see clear signs that emergency lending programs can go away,” said Ed Moya, Oanda senior market analyst. “Wall Street is wondering which bank could be the next one that needs a rescue and that is making it easy to pick on the other regional banks.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/135szpc/pacwest_western_alliance_lead_regional_bank_stock/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/135szpc/pacwest_western_alliance_lead_regional_bank_stock/,24,39,2023-05-02 16:34:03,ourpseudonym,"I'm holding all my WAL still. Their financials are doing fine, just short term market panic.

I used to work for the boutique firm that did almost all of PacWest's investment banking.  Back in the early-00s I would drive around Southern California with one of the partners jawboning with small banks, several of which PacWest ultimately acquired.  I was always skeptical of the grow-by-acquisition strategy and a few times at staff meetings I would ask, ""Do we ever go back and compare our original acquisition model assumptions with the actual results?""  Crickets ensued.  I always found that kind of amusing.  As you can imagine, we eventually parted ways.  Probably added about zero value to PacWest over the long-term... but it was fun and profitable.  Good times.

Banks are an easy pass. I don't know why investors play hot potato when stocks like these have huge trouble ahead. 

Don't do it.

So we do what? Go to cash, buy some way OTM pacw puts, hope we eventually are permitted to cash them in, and... buy some of the leftover ashes?

Exactly the same situation with Frc, just hope the media doesn’t create another panic. (They will)

Banks are an easy pass for me too. Now that I lost $30k on SVB, I can say I will never buy stock in a bank again. They are wild. 

If a company with a widget makes a mistake, like a social media fax pas or a faulty product, some portion of their market will abandon them. Sales will take a hit, they will drop prices, new buyers will enter. Over time, things will normalize. 

If a bank loses customer confidence, it is done. DONE. 
All these articles about the next bank etc are creating exactly the loss in confidence needed to kill the company.

So far, today, I've sold some PACW puts and bought another lot of their preferred shares.

FRC had negative earnings and could not liquidate to cover without breaching capital ratios.

That is not true for PACW/WAL

Frc had ~70% of its deposits as uninsured. WAL is the opposite with roughly 70% of its deposits insured. WAL has way more small customers than frc and don't need to panic if a couple big fish pull out, and there isn't any reason for the little fish to leave since they are insured.

Yeah, this is the real problem in the market now. If shorts drop the stock enough, people will panic and pull their money out, rinse and repeat.


FRC shouldn’t have failed."
Investing,Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls Shock,"Gold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal’s belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

“Gold’s short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,” said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York’s Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price — which reflects bullion for prompt delivery — instead of futures.

“Gold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,” said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. “From there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.”

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday’s rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

“There's a bit of disbelief around this number,” said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. “I wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.”

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

“Gold’s best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won’t persist,” said OANDA’s Moya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n75u6r/gold_has_best_week_since_october_on_us_payrolls/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n75u6r/gold_has_best_week_since_october_on_us_payrolls/,22,16,2021-05-07 18:49:13,reconditedamsel7,"**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

I prefer the title dollar has worst week vs gold.

Real rates have been declining since ~mid-March, [and gold follows](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=r87P).

Been loading up on gold. Gold shares like harmony and Goldfields going to do well coming months.

I love gooooollld. But I bought a protective put on GLD just incase.

It’s funny that you could expect the opposite effect and headlines could be written that way if gold dropped. If unemployment drops and economy runs hot, that’s a sign of inflation which should help gold.

But traders are banking on the reaction (or no reaction in this case) to the fed on interest rates rather than the inflation itself.

Yay the economy is bad so my stocks are going to do good.

Reminder that while dollar's purchasing power is at historic lows against most assets, dollar is still very strong as a currency (unless you count those dog themed e-pogs as currency) as it's still the safe haven, default reserve, and whatever quantities of cash the US printer has printed has largely been matched by the printers of all the others governments. Those that didn't print have devaluing currencies also because their countries have likely gotten absolutely wrecked to the point where their currency isn't viable.

In some cases the dollar is at historic highs against currencies like the Brazilian Real and the country is still getting wrecked."
Investing,Stock market bloodbath: Dow and Nasdaq plummet in the worst day since June,"Thursday was the Nasdaq's largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group.

All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.

So, what happened?

For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes — the Dow (INDU) and the S&P 500 (SPX) — for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.

Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red.

""Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.

But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.

""The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.

The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.

The investors second guessing big tech are wrong.

The economy will never just ‘pick up steam to void need of safety picks’

Big tech grows in good times and bad times aka all times.

There is no evidence whatsoever that this has changed.

what happens if sugar bottoms out? You get fucked and only walk away with the premium from the futures contract.

Your CFDs have counter party risk, they could at any moment suspend trading, widen the spreads.  Your stop loss is not guaranteed, etc....

I looked at trading wheat futures via CFD in the past (not Oanda). Everything looked like an 18% nearly guaranteed ROI. But then I realized that storage costs were to be charged by the exchange provider for long-term positions and they hid this on their platform. The 18% ROI turned into a small negative return after that. 

Generally speaking, I don’t think there would be many opportunities for guaranteed ROI like that. People who actively trade these commodities would have taken advantage of this long before it got to this point. 

I would just call Oanda and ask them how you would put up this trade.

If sugar bottoms out my long cfd position would get stopped loss at the strike price but my short futures position would be assigned, earning the difference in the strike price and initial price, along with the premium. It’s a short and long position in equal notional value so theoretically I’m completely hedged

Great point there, but I guess that’s a risk I’m willing to take for the expected return

ok yes excuse me I am mixing up derivatives here. It sounds like you would make money between the strike price of the CFD and the spot price of the commodity today of $10, that is an interesting situation. You may have found an arbitrage opportunity I wonder if there is any nuance to the CFD, is there a transaction cost for enterring in that?

Only transaction cost would be the bidask spread which is pennies compared to the notional value. I wouldn’t be surprised if I found an arbitrage situation but with a 20% riskless yield, sounds too good to be true."

Forex, especially with the amount of leverage the brokers allow, is a very VERY dangerous gamble for a novice to make.  Use their demo mode for a long time to prove you actually know what you are doing before putting any real money to use.  When you do put real money to work, it had better be money you can afford to lose.

IMO unless you are a full time pro then currency trading on the short term with these huge amounts of leverage is basically gambling.

Or is it just that the lower minimum deposit brokerages don't allow day trading ? thanks for any helpful answers",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/47hc08/regulation_t_question/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/47hc08/regulation_t_question/,3,9,2016-02-25 04:59:14,daemonika,"Reg T says you can't sell a security you haven't paid for yet with settled funds. Attempting to do so is a free riding violation. There is no way around it in a cash account and it isn't a broker rule it is a federal regulation. You must either wait for your previous sales to settle or deposit more funds. If you commit enough free riding violations (3 I think), your account will be restricted to purchasing securities with settled funds only. 

Alternatively you could use a margin account instead of a cash account (this Reg T rule doesn't apply to margin accounts), but then you need to be aware of the Pattern Day Trading rule that do apply to margin accounts.

[deleted]

That's not limited margin. Still a cash account. It would be an unsettled trade liquidation. Wait till gdx settles and you are good

I'm confused lol. The money I'm using is from my bank account idk how I could be using money I don't have...also is gdx a special kind of stock ? Like if it was apple could i buy and sell x2 without this reg T thing?

After you purchase something in a cash account it takes three business days to be settled. It has nothing to do with whether or not you had the money in your account or not. It's the funds changing hands. As mentioned previously if you liquidate your position you will be free riding and subject to the penalties that entails.

The way to avoid this is to have a margin account. However you can not make a round trip in one business day with an account balance of less than 25k (well, you can make 3 in a rolling 5 day period, but more than that and you're out for 90 days). If you have more than 25k you trade as much as you like in a day.

ohhhh that makes sense thanks a lot

I'd recommend you upgrade to a margin account for this reason.  If something starts going against you, you want to be able to get out without jumping through hoops.

Yep...I'm stuck in nugt which is pretty volatile until monday"
Investing,Top ten outrageous predictions for Saxo Bank in 2015,"Top ten outrageous predictions for Saxo Bank in 2015

1.	Saxo Bank dishonor CHF trades on January 15, 2015, after the SNB decision to remove the EURCHF floor. And yet no clients complain about it.

2.	Saxo Bank make up a price of EURCHF and other cross-CHF exchange rates with reference to EBS prices, replacing the prices it quoted to clients as a market maker, 12 hours after completion of transactions.

3.	Saxo Bank is convinced that tradable prices quoted on their trading platform were quoted by someone else instead of Saxo Bank itself.

4.	Saxo Bank believes that no one is curious on how Saxo Bank hedge against clients’ short CHF positions.

5.	Saxo Bank spend less than 1 minute to figure out how much they lose on their own CHF positions (cause it’s right on their screens), but they needed 12 hours to figure out how to allocate the losses to clients.

6.	On the second day of the Swiss Franc appreciation, Saxo Bank tell people that more clients joined them, despite they dishonor trades, manipulate trade records, detain clients’ assets and go after clients’ on the alleged debt that Saxo Bank booked to them.

7.	Saxo Bank believes that international clients will not sue them in Denmark due to the language barrier.

8.	Saxo Bank believes that they can pocket this windfall gain from clients’ assets and next year they can go to IPO.

9.	Saxo Bank still cannot understand why some brokers such as Oanda forgive retail clients’ negative balances – though these brokers dare not to manipulate trade records.

10.	Danish FSA and regulators around the world decide to forgive Saxo Bank. Saxo Bank continues to write outrageous predictions for 2016.

Investing,"So, here's the plan.","I'm 25 years old and debt free. 

I'm in the military. I don't make a lot, but I live well within my means and can rely on Uncle Sam for my health and dental, so that's a good plus. It also allows me to be a USAA member, and I plan on using them for my trading. I already do my banking and insurance through them as well. 

I already have $30k in a mutual fund through Franklin-Templeton that's doing fairly well, that's been running since last year. Not taking any out of that until I'm in my 50s unless it's a matter of homelessness. 

I have about $40k just sitting around doing nothing. The plan is to keep half of that as my emergency fund (on top of another $10k emergency fund that I pretend doesn't exist) and put the rest of it to work. 

I'm looking at a decent portfolio and plan on dividing that $20k up pretty evenly among these:

Cisco (CSCO): 13.1 P/E, near the low end of their 52wk range and 3.4% yield. Plus they're a little safer due to gov't contracts out the wazoo. Yespls.

Microsoft (MSFT): 14.2 P/E, 2.8% yield,  but close to the highest share price they've seen all year. Still considering it based on XB1 and windows phone starting to pick up steam in their respective markets, plus with Windows 9 coming soonish should be a good deal. 

Intel (INTC): 13.8 P/E, 3.5% yield, mid - high based on ttm. Upcoming 6 physical core chips have got me fairly excited for both the hardware and this stock.

ConocoPhillips (COP): 13.7 P/E, 3.9% yield. Can you *really* go wrong with oil, especially starting into the summer months? 

General Electric (GE): 15.6 P/E, 3.4% yield. Pretty rock solid energy sector stock.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): 17.8 P/E, 2.7% yield. Another solid company. They've got their fingers in so many different products it's basically just market trend. 

Facebook (FB): Outrageous P/E, no yield. I'm going to wait until their price slide levels off and buy in for about half as much as I'm putting into the others. Their next announcement is 1 May. If it's looking good, I'll double up. If not, I'll hang on to what I've got until Oculus releases a consumer version of their headset. I've had their first dev kit for a while now and that's enough to make me a believer, Oculus is going to be huge. 

...aaand I might piss around with a couple thousand in Forex for funsies. Had a demo account with Oanda a little while back and doubled my monopoly money over 2 months. If I can do well with it in another demo, I'm going in for reals.

I've pretty much already made up my mind that I'm okay with this money not even existing. It's not like I need it to live comfortably and I've got plenty of backup funds. I guess what I'm looking for is a sanity check on this, like maybe you could point out something absolutely mental that I might have missed. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/21s0l7/so_heres_the_plan/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/21s0l7/so_heres_the_plan/,0,16,2014-03-30 21:57:59,jimmysaint13,"Take all your money out of that mutual fund, you're getting destroyed with fees.

The first thing you should do is max your TSA. The TSA is the best investment vehicle available.

After that you should open a Roth IRA, I suggest with Vanguard. Put your money into index funds or a target retirement fund.

Stay the hell away from Forex. It's a zero-sum game, and with commissions it's actually a slightly negative-sum game. You'd be just as well off taking your money into a casino.

Low cost index funds are your best bet. 

I don't think your portfolio would have enough diversification. Too much tech, too much energy. Also, stay away from forex. 

If I were you I would become very comfortable with reading the reports that companies file with the SEC. You should know all about 10K, 10Q, 8K, forms 3, 4, 5, and Proxy Filings.

It is best to get your information directly from the companies themselves, not from analysts or other people's opinions. You are in charge of your investment portfolio and you need to be able to justify any transactions you make.

Also, I strongly suggest reading ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham. It has excellent reviews and is regarded as one of (if not the) best books on investing ever written. It will tell you, among other things, that following the herd is very likely going to get you burned.

I agree that you should stay away from Forex too, as you are solely dependent on the monetary policy of foreign governments, which can print money and do other things to make the value of their currency especially unpredictable. 

CSCO has been a dud for the last year or so, consider writing cover calls to increase gains. INTL, I would avoid, also a feast or famine stock. I also think Oculus is will be virtually non-material to FB for the forseeable future. 

You could consider some ETFs with lower fees for diversity (maybe XLE, XLF, etc.) , Forex is for the most part a shit-storm. 

If you're willing to do some research, I'd even say that it may not be a terrible idea to use 10-20% of your intended portfolio on speculative plays (well researched, educated investments). It'd be better than going to a casino.

Why are you picking individual companies with a heavy leaning towards energy and tech?  Is there something wrong with ETFs such as SPY?

Have you actually done any research on these companies?  Are their earnings increasing or stable?  What is their debt/asset ratio?  Do you know anything about the actual business side of these companies or are you simply picking companies whose names you know of?

I have to agree with one of the comments below... as a 25 year old, 75% of your portfolio should be in stocks. Sounds like your current worth it about $90K, so something like $67.5K should be going into stocks, rather than a mutual fund.

You're young and you can afford the risk. 

As for one of the comments below hounding at you for picking ""name-brand"" stocks... there's nothing wrong with picking blue-chip stocks, but I might substitute Facebook for Tesla, but that's just me :)

Edit: Wanted to return to say that an emergency fund should be approximately equal to 6 months of living. Consider things like insurance (car, home, auto, health, etc.), bills (utilities, phone bill, etc), food, gas, mortgage, etc. Take that amount, and subtract it from the total amount you have available to invest. Then 75% of that should be in stocks if you want to be on par to retire on time.

What do you think another good sector would be? I do realize I'm a bit tech - heavy, but that's the field I'm already in, I work IT for the Air Force. Paraphrasing Peter Lynch, you should invest in companies you already know, the quickest way to lose is to get into a company in a field you know nothing about. 

I've thought about Activision-Blizzard, but it just doesn't seem like a good time to buy in with them right now. WoW is their biggest cash cow and has been in slow, steady decline for a while now. They also recently released a new expansion for Diablo 3 that was well received, but that was a few weeks ago and I feel like the benefits have already been reaped on that. With no other prospective releases on the horizon, I'm hesitant. 

I've been looking at Philip - Morris, too. Nothing creates reliable revenue like addiction. 

So what do you think? Maybe drop GE and Intel in favor of entertainment and cigarettes? 

You know that mutual funds can hold stocks, right...? "

just window dressing per end of quarter.  dont be dog and chase price!   you didnt buy it when it was below 2k and now you want to buy it up 10% and become bagholders.

this is astrology

It’ll work until it doesn’t. Gold is highly based on macroeconomic elements, and if there’s a change, your strategy can go bottoms up easy

There are other factors cause the price rise, and I think most people will not like what I am about to say. 

The price of gold is rising versus the US dollar because the value of the dollar is weakening against most currencies of modern economies. Like it or not, the US National debt of $33 trillion dollars is undermining the value of the dollar. 

The only major currency that I can think of that is weakening versus the dollar is the Japanese yen, which I am loving. I arrived in Japan on Wednesday to look for a home to buy. The dollar is currently at a 34 year high against the yen.

Small cap gold miners is next!

2241

Just wondering why silver and other precious metals are not also appreciating. So far, it’s mainly gold that appreciates.

Yet, all the gold miners trade at their 2020 price levels

I made a note of that consensus estimate on Jan 9 so I could look back and see how that worked out.  


a) It was totally wrong.  
b) Despite falling recently we are WAY off that.

Same pattern as earlier this year.  Watch for 3800 support and buy in.  3600 would only occur in a short window if Puntang and Netanyahoo don’t lay off the weapons.

It takes a 2-3 years before we realize how bad shit is. We are almost at that point. It's going to fall off.

How do I make this make sense as someone whose never traded SPX but trades SPY daily? You divide SPX by 10 right?

Does that mean 3600 at the end of the year? If so that’s still a couple months away.

I dont think it was wrong, delayed maybe.

Yes… true. Still 2 months in the year. But it would be a much more significant decrease from this point.

About a 13% drop."

StockMarket,Tesla shares rebound from January bottom," 

[Shares of Tesla](https://www.foxbusiness.com/search?q=tesla&ss=fb) cleared $200 on Thursday as the stock continues to obliterate losses from the past year.

In 2023, shareholders for the automotive, [artificial intelligence](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/artificial-intelligence), and clean energy company watched the stock price nearly double after hitting a 52-week low of $101.81, on Jan. 6.

In an interview with FOX Business, Edward Moya, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York said, ""Wall Street still has its doubts about growth but is very optimistic that the worst is over for some of the more beaten-up tech stocks.""

""Tesla's rally can't be stopped right now as investors remain upbeat about growth in the EV space and on the global economic outlook for Europe and China,"" he added.

 Since hitting its low point last month, Tesla stock has rallied nearly 90% through Wednesday.

Currently, the stock has been up eight consecutive days; up 26.99% over this period to notch the longest winning streak since July 22, 2022, when it rose for eight straight trading days.

Also on Thursday, Tesla is the most active stock in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 and is the second-best performer in the tech-heavy index, as tracked by the Dow Jones Market Data Group.

The last time Tesla stock closed above $200 was Nov. 4, while the last time shares reached $200 was on Nov. 15.

 Tesla's most [recent earnings report](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/tesla-posts-q4-financial-results-ceo-elon-musk-earnings-call) and changes in the federal government's electric vehicle tax credit are helping shares.

Elon Musk's company said it generated about $24.32 billion in [fourth-quarter revenue](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/earnings), marking a 37% increase from the same three-month period last year. The company’s profits saw a roughly 59% jump from 2021’s Q4 to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share came in at $1.19.

Refinitiv estimates for revenue and EPS were $24.16 billion and $1.13 respectively, meaning [Tesla](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/tesla) came in higher on both.

In January, Tesla slashed the price of its baseline Model Y Long Range to $53,490 and Model Y Performance to $56,990.

[**GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products)

# [Stock futures rise as Wall Street tries to recover from Tuesday’s rocky session](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/01/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures traded higher Wednesday as Wall Street tries to recover its footing after a tough first session of the year.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55 points, or 0.17%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.23% and 0.44%, respectively.
*****
> Sentiment was boosted in part by encouraging inflation data from Europe, including a greater-than-expected decline in the French consumer price index and a drop in German import prices.
*****
> U.S. stocks started 2023 on a downbeat note Tuesday as rising rate concerns, high inflation and recessionary fears crushed hopes that Wall Street could kick off the new year on a positive note. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively, while the Dow closed just below breakeven. The major indexes were also pressured by steep declines in Apple and Tesla shares.
*****
> “U.S. stocks were unable to hold onto earlier gains as restrictive policy and recession fears remained front and center for investors,” wrote Oanda’s senior market analyst Ed Moya in a note to clients Tuesday. “Discount buying triggered another bear market rebound that didn’t last long at all.”
*****
> Investors will gain more insight into what Fed members are thinking on Wednesday afternoon as minutes from the central bank’s latest policy meeting are released. Earlier in the day, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, and ISM manufacturing data are due out.
*****
> Friday’s December jobs report also will be closely watched as it is the last read on the labor market before the Fed meeting in February.
*****
> “It is too early to start betting on a Fed pivot this year and that should make this difficult environment for stocks,” Moya said.

StockMarket,CarMax’s Huge Earnings Miss Sends Warning Signal on US Consumer - Another Troubling Data Point to Weakening Consumer Sentiment,"*  Auto dealers Carvana, Sonic Automotive plunge in broad selloff
* Rising rates, low confidence makes consumers wary of spending

**CarMax’s fiscal second-quarter numbers failed to meet Wall Street’s expectations on nearly every metric**. **The** **company said** **the ability of potential buyers to afford vehicles has become a challenge, with rising interest rates and low consumer confidence adding further wrinkles.**

“**CarMax has reminded Wall Street that parts of the economy are already in a recession**,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. The “affordability challenges” highlighted by the company as the main reason for the big miss suggests it is “only going to get worse as Fed tightening starts to impact the economy,” Moya added.

“When you combine these results with the story from yesterday that demand for iPhones is weak, it raises the question about the consumer as we move toward the holiday selling season,” said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. **“If the consumer is weak, you can take a soft landing off the table.”**  

""**The story of CarMax’s second-quarter is clear: demand destruction,”** said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. “High used car prices and rising rates are causing a buyers’ strike.”

CarMax has No Moat.

CarMax overbids at wholesale auctions - and then attempts to pass their excess cost onto the consumer.

CarMax is an attempt to create a High End Used Car.

Lol. There is NO such Market! 

If people can afford CarMax -they can afford a NEW car. 

That's the bottom line. Every time. No moat.

Hard landing is also off the table

Carvana is a joke.  

Looking at a RAV4 and I can get a new one from Toyota cheaper than what Carvana wants for  for a 2 year old RAV4 with 30k miles.

The whole point of rising rates is to decrease consumer demand. A soft landing is really just multiple hard landings cancelling each other out. 

Hot take: this is a good sign that demand is finally cooling off.

This is not the consumer s problem, but the greedy used car dealers problems. Like other comments said some used cars are more expensive than new.

I find my used cars in the same place I find my strippers and blow: Craigslist

Plop landing incoming

The problem with this logic is that you are assuming you can get a new toyota rav4, a popular model, in a short time and at msrp easily, which not gonna happen

When new cars are actually available and and prices coming down, used car prices will come down substantially more

I remember toyota said awhile back that their dealership inventory has 36h availability on average , not measured by days or weeks, hours

Polar Bear Plunge.  Why not, winter is coming.

I could order one today and have it 2-3 weeks.  The are selling cars that are in transit to the dealership.  My lease which has about $6k in positive equity is up in December."
StockMarket,Gold Edges Lower Toward Two-Year Low After Parade of Rate Hikes,"Bullion pares losses after Japan strengthens its currency

Haven status boosted as global outlook deteriorates: Oanda

Gold edged lower after a volatile session as a parade of central banks followed the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates to cool inflation.

**Bullion lost as much 1.1% on Thursday after Japan** **intervened** **in the foreign exchange market to strengthen its currency, causing the greenback to slide and bond yields to climb. It continues to trade near a two-year low, and could enter a bear market as the dollar remains at record levels.**

**Central banks including Switzerland, Norway and Britain followed the Fed’s lead in announcing interest-rate hikes to curb price increases**.

**“Gold is clearly going to become a safe haven as the global outlook deteriorates and as Wall Street grows confident that we are nearing the peak with Treasury yields,**” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. The metal has **“massive support at the $1,660 level and if it can stabilize above there, prices could eventually make a move back above the $1,700 level,”** he added.

# [Stock futures flat following the S&P 500′s third straight losing day](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/23/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed Wednesday as investors await more guidance from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the central bank’s tightening path.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 were all roughly flat.
*****
> Both the Dow and the S&P 500 declined for a third straight session Tuesday amid relatively thin trading volumes. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite finished Tuesday little changed. The S&P 500 is about flat on the month after rallying more than 9% in July.
*****
> The three-day Jackson Hole economic symposium starts Thursday with Powell slated to speak Friday morning. Fed watchers expect him to reinforce the central bank’s goal of squashing inflation and keeping expectations about future prices gains in check.
*****
> “Financial markets will remain in choppy waters until Fed Chair Powell’s Jackson Hole speech on Friday,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “He may struggle to convince markets that he is comfortable with tightening policy and triggering a recession. The economy is clearly slowing but it is still too early for the Fed to signal that they will be less aggressive with tightening policy.”
*****
> Investors will also monitor incoming data to gauge the health of the economy. Durable goods and pending home sales are on deck for Wednesday.

*****
> Stock futures inched higher Tuesday as the market tried to recover from its worst day since June.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average added 40 points, or 0.1%, while S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures also gained 0.1%.
*****
> Palo Alto Networks surged in the premarket on the back of strong quarterly results, while Zoom Video shares slumped after the video conferencing company lowered its full-year forecast.
*****
> Wall Street is coming off a downbeat session, as a summer rally continued to fade amid mounting rate hike concerns.
*****
> The Dow dropped more than 600 points Monday, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell more than 2% each. Those were the biggest one-day drops for the Dow and S&P 500 since June 16. The Nasdaq suffered its worst session since June 28.
*****
> Monday’s sell-off was broad-based, with all 11 S&P 500 sectors closing lower, led by declines in information technology and consumer discretionary stocks. A slide in tech stocks weighed down the tech-heavy Nasdaq.
*****
> “The global growth story is in shambles right now,” said Ed Moya, a senior market analyst at Oanda. “That’s what’s really kind of weighing on risk appetite right now because you can’t have the U.S. continue to be attractive while the rest of the world is crumbling.”
*****
> This sentiment will continue to put pressure on big tech and consumer discretionary stocks, he said. Moya, echoing other investors, expects another round of hawkish pushback from Fed chair Jerome Powell when he speaks Friday at the central bank’s annual Jackson Hole economic symposium.
*****
> Earnings season continues Tuesday with results from Macy’s, Nordstrom and Dick’s Sporting Goods. July new home sales will also be reported, along with August manufacturing PMI and the August Richmond Fed survey.

# [Stock futures fall slightly after big Fed rally, Meta shares decline](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures moved lower Thursday after markets staged a major rally in the previous session following another 0.75 percentage point hike from the Federal Reserve.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 47 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 futures lost 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 0.6%.
*****
> Shares of Meta Platforms dipped 5.9% in premarket trading on the back of disappointing quarterly results, while Ford gained more than 5% after a beat on the top and bottom lines, and as it raised its dividend. Teladoc cratered more than 25% after taking another large goodwill charge.
*****
> The moves come on the heels of a broad-based rally Wednesday after the Fed’s latest monetary policy decision, as investors continued to bet on whether the central bank can halt surging prices without pushing the economy into a recession.
*****
> Following the rate hike from the Fed, DoubleLine Capital’s CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told CNBC’s “Closing Bell Overtime” he believes the central bank is no longer behind the curve on inflation and Powell has regained credibility.
*****
> “This market reaction seems less of a sugar high than the prior two in June and May,” Gundlach said.
*****
> The Dow jumped more than 400 points in the previous session, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.6% and 4.06%, respectively.
*****
> All S&P 500 sectors ended the day higher, with communications services posting its best daily performance since April 2020.
*****
> “For the most part, what’s really driving this move is that the economy is still performing okay and it looks like the Fed is probably going to slow the pace of tightening down by the next policy meeting,” said Ed Moya, Oanda’s senior market analyst.
*****
> Investors have grown increasingly concerned in recent months that the central bank’s attempts to tame surging prices would move the economy closer to a recession, if it hasn’t already entered one.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said during a press conference he does not believe the economy has entered a recession.
*****
> “I do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession and the reason is there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,” he said.
*****
> Investors looking for further clues into the state of the economy are awaiting a reading on second-quarter GDP slated for Thursday. While two back-to-back negative quarters of growth is viewed by many as a recession, the official definition is more nuanced, taking into account additional factors, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
*****
> Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the economy to have barely expanded last quarter after contracting 1.6% in the first.
*****
> On the earnings front, investors are looking ahead to results from Apple, Amazon, Intel and Roku slated for after the bell.

# [Stock futures dip slightly as market attempts to build on Monday’s comeback](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell slightly on Tuesday a day after a big reversal in markets gave some traders hope the April sell-off was nearing an end.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased about 140 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 futures were down about 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.4%.
*****
> On Monday, the Dow advanced more than 200 points, after cutting a near 500-point loss from earlier in the day. The dramatic market reversal pushed the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.3% and the S&P 500 up by 0.6%.
*****
> “Quite an impressive reversal, unfortunately we don’t believe that [Monday’s] low is the end of the market’s drawdown,” wrote Rob Ginsberg, technical analyst with Wolfe Research. “The sell-off still feels a bit too orderly to us.”
*****
> The bounce was welcomed by investors after stocks ended the previous week on a sour note, with the Dow falling to its fourth losing week in a row and the S&P and Nasdaq hitting three-week losing streaks Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell into bear market territory last week, but after Monday’s comeback sits 19.8% from its record. For April, the S&P 500 is off by 5% and the Nasdaq is down more than 8%.
*****
> Monday’s reversal was led by names like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which rallied in the afternoon amid falling interest rates and ahead of an intense week of earnings for mega cap tech stocks. Twitter also jumped after its board accepted Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s offer to take it private.
*****
> Alphabet and Microsoft were slightly higher in premarket trading Tuesday before their quarterly reports after the bell. Meta, Amazon and Apple will report later in the week.
*****
> UPS shares added more than 1% in premarket trading after the shipper’s quarterly earnings and revenue topped expectations. The company also reaffirmed its guidance. 3M shares were marginally higher in premarket trading after first-quarter results topped expectations.
*****
> “A third of the S&P is reporting [earnings] this week, and you’re probably going to see much of the same: lots of top- and bottom-line beats. Companies are going to talk about margin pressures and passing on price increases to the consumer, but they’re still going to highlight there’s still overall optimism about the economy,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, told CNBC.
*****
> Between the continuation of strong earnings and a quiet period from the Federal Reserve, there will likely be a relief rally in the market, Moya added.
*****
> “We’re not going to be getting more nervousness about Fed tightening, because we won’t be hearing much more about it until the May meeting,” he said.
*****
> In economic data, investors are expecting fresh numbers for new home sales and consumer confidence Tuesday morning.

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as a big week of economic data kicks off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures were steady Monday morning as a week filled with key economic reports kicked off, and investors continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve’s planned interest rate hikes.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 points, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
> Shares of Tesla popped more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday on news it wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders.
*****
> The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said Tesla will ask at its annual shareholders meeting “for an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company’s common stock in the form of a stock dividend.”
*****
> Elsewhere on Monday, parts of The Treasury yield curve inverted on Monday, raising some recession concerns. Earlier on Monday, the yield on the 5-year Treasury note rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%.
*****
> However, the main yield spread that traders watch — the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate — remained positive for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Friday to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.
*****
> The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia’s war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed’s plans to hike interest rates.
*****
> “It seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Geopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won’t be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.”
*****
> Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank’s chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.
*****
> On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.
*****
> Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.
*****
> Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

StockMarket,Can a broker( Oanda) change their rollover fee or financing fee from positive to negative overnight without warning?,"  

Hi, 

I am with Oanda as my broker. I trade mostly positive swap pairs or bonds.

I have a few long positions in us t bond @ 1.40% for a few months 

On the 22 Feb 2022, the long position rate was 1.40% which means I receive a few dollars per day because I am long. 

Suddenly on 23 Feb 2022, the long position has changed to -5.40% now I paying instead of earning. 

My understanding is they would decrease but gradually but not from 1.40% to -5.40% overnight. that's a 6% decrease in one night. They didn't send emails or make any announcements. 

At this is point it's more gambling than trading since the dealer would change the rules based on their good-willing. 

The Fed hasn't changed its rate yet how did Oanda just decide to change its rate like that ? 

This is like a no-brainer game for the broker to take to the other side of the trade since they change their rate so drastically most traders on their platform will be forced to pay a hefty daily fee or close their positions to avoid daily negative fees market will tank. 

How could the broker decrease a 6% in one night without any announcement? IS this even legal? If they are allowed it means they can manipulate the market at their will. All it takes it's to play with the daily rollover fee over and over. Even a kid would make money if he's the dealer. 

I understand there would be a gradual increase or decrease in rollover fee but I never saw 6% just like that from 1.4% to -5.4% ( long). 

Fed still hasn't changed their rate on US T-Bond what else could affect? 

I am in Canada. I would think to contact IIroc but I would like to have some feedback here. 

Something tells me this is misconduct.",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t1l7fb/can_a_broker_oanda_change_their_rollover_fee_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t1l7fb/can_a_broker_oanda_change_their_rollover_fee_or/,0,1,2022-02-26 02:11:17,MagicFlyingBird,Umm something pretty close to ww3 started so stuff can and will change fast

# [Stock futures are down slightly after major averages snap 3-day losing streak](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/15/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures edged lower in morning trading Wednesday, after registering gains the previous day amid signs of tensions easing between Russia and Ukraine.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were off by about 80 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 shares dipped 0.2% and Nasdaq 100 futures eased about 0.2%.
*****
> ViacomCBS was the biggest loser in early action Wednesday, with shares falling 6.5% premarket after the company said it is rebranding itself as Paramount Global to focus on streaming. At the same time, the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings.
*****
> Shares of Wynn Resorts rose 1.8% after the casino operator beat on revenue, though it posted a larger-than-expected loss per share.
*****
> Markets have been driven largely by concerns over the Russia-Ukraine conflict, and the Federal Reserve’s plan to hike interest rates.
*****
> “Traders continue to monitor the situa-tion in Ukraine and look ahead to the Fed minutes release,” Sevens Report’s Tom Essaye said in a note Wednesday morning.
*****
> In the most recent geopolitical developments, NATO officials accused Russia of massing troops at the Ukrainian border.
*****
> Energy prices, which have been sensitive to the news, moved sharply higher Wednesday morning, with natural gas up about 5% and oil prices climbing more than 1%.
*****
> President Joe Biden addressed the latest developments between Russia and Ukraine Tuesday afternoon, reiterating that the U.S. will defend NATO territory.
*****
> “If Russia proceeds, we will rally the world,” he said, adding that Washington’s allies were ready to impose powerful sanctions that will “undermine Russia’s ability to compete economically and strategically.”
*****
> The comments came after the Russian government said earlier Tuesdayin the day that some troops who had been on the Ukrainian border had returned to their bases.
*****
> This helped boost sentiment Tuesday on Wall Street. The yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury topped 2% as a risk-on tone returned to the market. Yields were little changed Wednesday, with the benchmark note slightly above 2%.
*****
> The major averages advanced Tuesday, snapping a three-day losing streak. The Dow gained 422 points, or 1.2%. The S&P added 1.58%, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 2.5%.
*****
> Technology was the top-performing S&P 500 sector, with nine out of the 11 groups registering gains on the day. Utilities and energy stocks were the two sectors in the red, dipping 0.6% and 1.4%, respectively.
*****
> “U.S. stocks rallied on optimism that it doesn’t seem like Russia will invade Ukraine this week and despite another hot PPI report, as many on Wall Street are still not convinced the Fed will be as aggressive as some are calling for this year,” said Oanda’s Ed Moya.
*****
> The Labor Department said Tuesday that wholesale prices jumped 1% in January, bringing the gain over the past 12 months to 9.7% on an unadjusted basis.
*****
> As inflation runs hot, Wall Street is looking ahead to the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s January meeting, which will be released Wednesday at 2 p.m. ET.
*****
> The summary could be viewed as stale considering the meeting happened before the most recent data. However, investors will be searching for any new insights into the number and size of rate hikes, as well as details of a balance sheet reduction plan.
*****
> “The latest inflation data continue to decimate the ‘inflation is purely transitory’ theory,’” said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
*****
> “After pricing in less than one Fed hike as of last September, markets and Fed watchers now expect between 6 and 7 hikes over the next year, with some arguing for a 50 basis point move and not just 25,” Cembalest added.
*****
> Retail sales data will also be released Wednesday at 8:30 a.m. on Wall Street. Economists are expecting the report to show that sales rose 2.1% in January. That compares to a 1.9% decline in December.

*****

*****
> Also, Pfizer shares tumbled 4% after the drugmaker’s fourth-quarter revenue came in lower than Wall Street analysts expected. The company’s full-year earnings guidance also disappointed.
*****
> Shares of Snap fell 3.5% after the social media company announced a new debt offering.
*****
> On the economic calendar, investors will get a look at December’s trade balance, with a Dow Jones survey pointing to an $82.8 billion shortfall, which would be a record.
*****
> Wall Street is on edge watching how the Federal Reserve will react to the intensifying price pressures. Bank of America on Monday reiterated its call for the Fed to hike rates 1.75 percentage points, or seven times, this year in an effort to head off inflation pressures which have been accelerated by rising rages.
*****
> Treasury yields hit fresh pandemic-era highs Monday and rose again Tuesday. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note most recently yielded 1.93%, a level not seen since January 2020.

*****
> On Thursday the Labor Department will release January’s consumer price index data. The reading follows a stronger-than-expected January jobs report, which has led to speculation that the Federal Reserve could be more aggressive when it comes to hiking rates. The inflation data is expected to show that prices rose 0.4% in January, for a 7.2% gain from one year ago, which would be the highest in almost 40 years.
*****
> “The tumultuous market action continues as the combination of Fed policy uncertainty and economic transition remains in focus,” Canaccord Genuity said Monday in a note to clients.

# [Stock futures are lower after major averages post third straight day of gains](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/08/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures dipped early Thursday, after the major averages posted a third straight day of gains as traders bet that the omicron variant’s economic impacts won’t be as severe as initially thought.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average slid 106 points, or 0.3%. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were each off by 0.3%.
*****
> Stocks were set to give back some of their gains in recent days, with the move higher spurred by the belief that the omicron variant of Covid looks less severe than earlier forms.
*****
> The move comes a day ahead of important inflation news as the Labor Department on Friday releases the consumer price index for November. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the year-over-year growth rate to be 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.
*****
> Federal Reserve officials are expected to react to the burst in inflation by announcing next week that it will begin pulling back on its economic aid.
*****
> The first step will be accelerating the reduction in the central bank’s monthly bond purchases, with markets expecting the Fed to double the taper to $30 billion. That in turn could pave the way for interest rate hikes as soon as the spring of 2022 and mark the latest Fed policy pivot under Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
> Weekly jobless claims data will be released on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. on Wall Street. Economists are expecting the number of first-time-filers to come in at 211,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
> During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, with each registering a third straight day of gains. The S&P’s gain over the last three days is the strongest of the year, according to MKM Partners.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.64%, also registering a third day of gains. Apple had the most positive impact on the index, while Nvidia was the biggest drag.
*****
> Equities got a boost after Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday morning that a booster dose of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the new omicron variant.
*****
> “The range of possibilities is still wide, but in the bigger picture, we think the odds are still very much in favor of the pandemic phase winding down,” Bank of America wrote in a note to clients following the announcement. “In our view, COVID is here to stay, but a shift to the endemic phase is approaching where infections are common but severe outcomes / lockdowns / travel restrictions are not,” the firm added.
*****
> With Wednesday’s gain, the S&P 500 is now just 0.9% below its all-time intraday high from Nov. 22.
*****
> Ed Moya, senior market analyst with Oanda, said that the market is in a wait-and-see mode ahead of Friday’s inflation report, which could “fuel further Fed rate hike bets.” Economists are expecting the report to show that prices rose 0.7% in November month-over-month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
> “While growth and labor markets have provided reasons to be optimistic about the economy, inflation is also running hot and sits at a 30-year high,” UBS wrote in a recent note to clients. “With the omicron variant entering the picture, investors are now questioning what monetary policy will look like going forward. The pandemic has already greatly increased the uncertainty over the economic outlook,” the firm added, noting that its base case is that the Fed will be patient.
*****
> There are some notable earnings reports on Thursday, including from Oracle, Broadcom and Lululemon, all of which report after the market closes.

# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.
*****
> The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration’s mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.
*****
> Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.
*****
> Dow component Boeing’s shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.
*****
> “We remain cautious on S&P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,” said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy.
*****
> Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.
*****
> “Another risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell’s comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word ‘transitory’ indicate that the Fed’s focus is now inflation rather than employment.
*****
> During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.
*****
> “Investors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,” TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
> Wednesday’s whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.
*****
> “We’ve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,” said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. “The next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,” he added.
*****
> On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.
*****
> Thursday’s reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.

*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
> Home improvement giant Lowe’s got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
> Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
> Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company’s stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
> Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
> On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.

*****
> Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
> “US stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,” Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

# [Stock futures are little changed as market rally pauses with major averages at records](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/03/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures were flat during early morning trading on Thursday after the major averages closed at records following commentary from the Federal Reserve in the prior session.
*****
> The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus. Investors had long anticipated the move and liked that the Fed did not signal it would be any more aggressive than necessary in raising interest rates once the bond tapering was finished next year.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average were around flat on Thursday. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures hovered in positive territory.
*****
> The S&P 500 is up 1.2% for the week, pushing the S&P 500′s year-to-date return up to 24% as the benchmark enters a seasonally strong part of the year for markets.
*****
> Qualcomm led premarket gainers on the S&P 500, rallying nearly 7% following an earnings beat propelled by a 56% surge in smartphone chip sales. The company also provide strong guidance for the fourth quarter.
*****
> MGM shares gained nearly 5% after the casino operator announcing plans to sell the operations of its Mirage casino in Las Vegas to another operator. The company noted that no sales agreement had been reached and it did not mention any possible buyers.
*****
> Yet Moderna shares cratered after the drugmaker slashed its Covid-19 vaccine revenue outlook. The sotck was last down about 11%
*****
> And Roku was under pressure, falling more than 7% after the streaming platform reported disappointing third-quarter revenue.
*****
> During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow gained about 105 points, registering its fifth straight positive session. The 30-stock benchmark hit its 51st record intraday high of the year, and 42nd record close of 2021.
*****
> The S&P 500 also posted its fifth straight day of gains, advancing 0.65%. The index saw its 74th intraday high and 61st record close of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite gained 1.04%, and is on its longest daily winning streak since June 2020 following eight straight days of gains. The tech-heavy index saw both its 41st record high and close on Wednesday.
*****
> “The Fed’s tapering announcement removes a minor, but overhanging worry across markets, as investors had been waiting for this moment for months, and it reinforces the view that the economic recovery has a long runway, albeit with a low rate of growth,” said George Ball, chairman of Sanders Morris Harris.
*****
> “The Fed’s tapering announcement is a signal of economic strength, which is good for corporate earnings and markets,” he added.
*****
> The central bank said it will begin to curb the pace of its monthly bond-buying program “later this month.” This marks the Fed beginning to remove the significant stimulus it’s provided since the pandemic took hold.
*****
> The buying will slow by $15 billion per month, which means the quantitative easing should end by the middle of 2022, although the Fed reiterated flexibility saying the amount could change if warranted.
*****
> “The Fed did a good job communicating its intentions well in advance of today’s meeting, which is why we aren’t seeing a ‘taper-tantrum 2.0,’” said Lawrence Gillum, fixed income strategist at LPL Financial.
*****
> Elsewhere in the market, a number of earnings reports are on deck for Thursday before the opening bell. Toyota Motors, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Kellogg are among the companies set to post quarterly updates. After the bell, Dropbox, Expedia, Airbnb, Shake Shake, Square and Uber will post quarterly updates, among others.
*****
> ″[W]e’re coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,” said Oanda’s Craig Erlam. “The economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,” he added.
*****
> On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week’s number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.
*****
> October’s hotly anticipated jobs report will be released on Friday. Consensus estimates call for 450,000 jobs added, according to Dow Jones. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 194,000 in September, far short of the 500,000 estimate.

# [Dow futures edge higher a day after hitting another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures nudged higher during early morning trading on Wednesday after the Dow and S&P closed at record highs as earnings season continues.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33 points. S&P 500 futures were off flat while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 20 points.
*****
> During regular trading Tuesday, the Dow advanced roughly 15 points to end the day at an all-time high. It was the 30-stock benchmark’s third straight day of gains and fifth positive session in the last six. Earlier in the session the Dow had jumped about 150 points to also hit a record intraday high.
*****
> The S&P gained 0.18% for its ninth positive session in the last ten, and also hit both a record intraday and closing high. It was the benchmark index’s 70th intraday high of 2021, and 57th record closing of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.06% for its third positive session in four. Facebook weighed on the tech-heavy index, with shares of the social media company dipping 3.9%.
*****
> Microsoft and Alphabet were among the headline reports Tuesday after the market closed, with both topping revenue expectations. Microsoft shares rose 2.3% in premarket trading.
*****
> Texas Instruments shares tumbled 4% premarket after the company missed revenue estimates while Visa fell 2.5% despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Enphase Energy leaped 12.7% after reporting record revenue in face of supply chain headwinds.
*****
> Coca-Cola rose 2.6% premarket after the company posted a beat on the top and bottom lines and raised its outlook, saying the business was getting stronger particularly in areas where the Covid recovery has been the best.
*****
> “This earnings season has been about pricing momentum and whether consumers are able to handle surging costs,” noted Ed Moya, senior analyst at Oanda. “So far it seems the consumer can handle it,” he added.
*****
> So far roughly 30% of the S&P 500 has reported earnings. Of the names that have posted quarterly updates, 82% have topped earnings expectations, while 80% have exceeded revenue estimates. Strong results have been key to pushing the major averages to new highs.
*****
> “We see signs that there could be more gains to come in the final two months of the year,” said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. “Seasonal tailwinds, improving market internals, and clear signs of a peak in the Delta variant all provide potential fuel for equities heading into year-end, and we maintain our overweight equities recommendation as a result.”
*****
> Robinhood shares were getting slammed, down 11% the day after the trading app reported revenue well below expectations primarily due to weakness in crypto trading.
*****
> A busy earnings week continues on Wednesday with Coca-Cola, McDonald’s, Bristol-Myers, Boeing, General Motors and Harley-Davidson among the names on deck before the market opens. Ford, eBay and Yum China will provide quarterly updates after the market closes.
*****
> On the economic front, U.S. durable goods order data will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.

Mandelbrot also ventured into it with fractals and other ideas.

StockMarket,Dow climbs 150 points to touch an intraday record as investors look past weak economic data,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/28/stock-futures-mixed-after-fed-keeps-interest-rates-near-zero.html

1. The disappointing GDP number “was due to a drop in inventories so nothing to be too concerned about,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. 

2. I think we’re some way away from having had substantial further progress toward the maximum employment goal. I would want to see some strong job numbers.” Powell said. 

3. a separate data point showed that 400,000 people filed initial claims for unemployment benefits for the week ended July 24. That level is nearly double the pre-pandemic norm and above a Dow Jones estimate of 385,000.



U.S. stocks rose to record levels on Thursday as investors shrugged off economic data pointing slower-than-expected growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 200 points to hit an intraday record. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, also reaching a fresh high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed with a 0.3% gain amid a drop in Facebook and PayPal shares.

U.S. second-quarter gross domestic product accelerated 6.5% on an annualized basis, considerably less than the 8.4% Dow Jones estimate.

Meanwhile, a separate data point showed that 400,000 people filed initial claims for unemployment benefits for the week ended July 24. That level is nearly double the pre-pandemic norm and above a Dow Jones estimate of 385,000.

The disappointing GDP number “was due to a drop in inventories so nothing to be too concerned about,” said Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at Oanda. “Initial and continuing claims came in slightly higher than expected. That certainly justifies a more patient approach from the Fed though.”

Many investors were relieved that the Federal Reserve signaled no imminent plans for dialing back asset purchases. Fed Chairman Jerome Powell cautioned that although the economy is making progress toward its goals, it has a ways to go before the central bank would actually adjust its easy policies.

“We have some ground to cover on the labor market side,” Powell said. “I think we’re some way away from having had substantial further progress toward the maximum employment goal. I would want to see some strong job numbers.”

* Bitcoin rose 15% to its strongest level since mid-June on Monday.
* Positive remarks by Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Cathie Wood at ""The B Word"" event helped drive the gains.
* Chatter about Amazon possibly accepting bitcoin payments by the end of 2021 are seen as adding further support.

[Bitcoin](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) leapt 15% on Monday to rise above $38,000 for the first time in about six weeks, after remarks from influential commentators and a report that Amazon is considering accepting payments in the cryptocurrency helped restore bullish investor sentiment.

The coin was trading at around $38,750 as of 3:15 a.m. ET, representing a 33% gain so far this year. It had earlier hit a 24-hour high of about $39,544, its highest level since mid-June.

After being stuck in a descending slope for three months, bitcoin broke out at the top end of recent levels following [positive comments](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-predictions-crypto-cathie-wood-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-2021-7?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) from leading CEOs Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Cathie Wood at ""The B Word"" event last week.

Tesla CEO Musk said the electric-vehicle maker would be open to accepting [bitcoin as payment again](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/elon-musk-bitcoin-approach-cathie-wood-jack-dorsey-bword-conference-2021-7?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), as long as the mining community strives to move towards efficient energy use. Twitter boss Dorsey said that bitcoin is a big part of the social-media platform's future, and that he's working to make an accessible wallet for it via payments company Square.

A [report](https://www.cityam.com/amazon-definitely-lining-up-bitcoin-payments-and-token-confirms-insider/) from London's City A.M. about [Amazon](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) possibly accepting bitcoin payments by the end of 2021 also helped drive the digital currency's move higher. The roll-out may not take long, since the online retail giant has been working on these plans since 2019, a source told the newspaper, it reported.

Amazon is also looking to [hire someone](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/amazon-digital-currency-crypto-blockchain-initiatives-ledger-lead-job-posting-2021-7?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to lead its digital currency and blockchain initiatives.

The re-emergence of institutional experts, along with Goldman Sachs' recent [services](https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-settling-crypto-etps-in-europe-sources) for institutional trades in bitcoin, helped drive the weekend rally for bitcoin, Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note on Monday.

Lol stock market dweebs think they know why it’s pumping

This is literally your last chances get out of crypto before you see your money disappear.

Never have so many Governments and banking heads around the world from China, UK, Europe, US identified crypto (especially Bitcoin) as an entity to be crushed.  They are literally telling you point blank that they are going to crush Crypto.  They have never worked together like this before.

Their reasons are clear,  the anonymous nature of transactions leads crypto to organized crime and simply makes it too easy to hide revenue from the Government.  All Governments are worried about loosing tax revenue as a result of cryptocurrency transactions.

They are attacking crypto along several fronts.

1) Regulation.  Bring crypto exchanges into the current regulatory environment.  To crypto idiots, this looks like the establishment is finally going to adopt crypto. What it really does is setup legal arguments for the shutdown of these exchanges.  Why? Because there isn’t a crypto exchange on the planet that can meet organized crime regulations. They can’t, because crypto can’t be traced. 

2) the introduction of regulated crypto currency controlled by the central bank. This is competition, designed to remove any sort of public backlash from the imminent removal of crypto as any possibility as a currency of transaction, and pushes crypto to the fringes of use. It also reduces crypto to a single purpose, as an asset exchange between official currencies.  This removes any sort of demand for crypto by replacing it with something the establishment Iikes.  Once this is introduced, the closing of unregulated coins in exchanges will start.  This is where crypto exchanges will only be able to sell you those coins that meet organized crime regulation requirements.  Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum will ever meet those requirements. 

3) the new crypto does advance currency transactions.  The Feds new digital currency for instance has the capability to simply make credit cards obsolete.  That’s quite a shift in the industry. It will make waves. The waves will be all about this new crypto coin and how amazing it is for online transactions that are no longer hemorrhaging revenue to credit companies. This is where Bitcoin and Ethereum should have been.. but they’ll never be allowed to get there, Central bank heads have said this already, very explicitly.  “Bitcoin will never be used as a currency for transactions”.  <=== Google this, and see who said it.   While stability is important, that’s not the primary reason, although it’s an often used excuse. The primary reason is about control.  Currency use has always been about control. 


Cathy Wood, and Elon Musk are not in a position to influence policy around the world, and they are not large enough forces to overcome the establishment with respect to the use of currencies.  These are not the people who can protect your money if what I described comes to pass. 

It’s your money.  I just felt I had to warn you. Don’t say the writing wasn’t out there as literally every central bank has been telling people to stay away from Crypto due to regulations.

Shorts had to cover

this false surge in based entirely on the Amazon rumor.  Bitcoin will crash back toward $30.000 in a day or two or three.  Can't believe there are still idiots buying Bitcoin.

Bezos not going to allow Bitcoin. That’s Bitcoin holders running with a rumor. No chance

what is the 52-week price performance?

Damn this reminds me of what happened with $DPW  that was wild

A short squeeze.

Why did it pump then, genius?"

Grandpa BTC will rally when it wants to rally, and not a moment sooner

They can but the Bitcoin halving will drive it like every other cycle

tldr; Following a challenging year in 2022, positive signals are emerging for the future of Bitcoin (BTC). Institutional investors like BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) through the SEC has sparked optimism in the crypto market. This move marks a turning point in dispelling the notion of cryptocurrencies as a fleeting trend. Crypto adoption is slowly happening globally, and while Bitcoin ETFs have not ignited widespread interest, they have benefited crypto stocks. The trend of crypto stocks benefiting from Bitcoin ETFs may continue, but a spot Bitcoin ETF is critical for further mainstream acceptance. The performance of Bitcoin as a global reserve asset during recessions remains uncertain. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin could reach a price of $120,000 by the end of 2024, but volatility and market conditions can impact this forecast. Bitcoin's trading range in the next few years is expected to be influenced by factors such as central bank digital currencies, smart contracts, and public interest. Clarity on U.S. Bitcoin ETF approval, the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities, and the attractiveness of central bank digital currencies will significantly impact Bitcoin's trading range.

CryptoCurrency,Regulators Are Trying Turn Crypto Into Forex,"I used to trade forex over 10 years ago. There used to be a lot more brokers in the US. Also a lot of ECN overseas brokers accepted US residents. A lot of people in the US made a lot of money. They decided to crackdown on retail investors and shut down and fine many brokers. Now for the most part Forex trading is dead in the US. All the good ECN brokers are overseas and they all ban US traders because the US government makes it impossible for them to accept people from the US

So in the Land Of The Free we have two major forex brokers Oanda AKA regulated Market Maker and Forex.com. Google Forexpeacearmy and the name of each of those brokers for reviews. Almost all the reviews are negative with major fraud and theft of customer funds. Market makers are huge frauds and their number 1 goal is to steal your money and they will do anything to take it. They literally close your account if your a successful trader. 

It's not about protecting US citizens it's about control and all for them and none for us. It's all about fleasing US traders and taking their money. If you want to play with the big boys you need to be a corrupt banker or someone with power in the government. They want to do the same thing for crypto. They want to steal the technology and use it for evil. They could care less if you lose all your money. They want to control everything and make sure you stay poor so they can stay rich and in power.",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12oqz6x/regulators_are_trying_turn_crypto_into_forex/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/12oqz6x/regulators_are_trying_turn_crypto_into_forex/,36,41,2023-04-16 22:10:44,Creative310,"Only regulators I like are Warren G and Nate Dogg

Very close to how things in crypto are, I'd argue

This is exactly what satoshi nakomoto warned us about

Finally some content that makes sense. I absolutely agree, nothing good can come from regulation when the people making the rules are the ones being benefitted.

Gary Gensler just declared Forex a security

It's all about control

You hear that, institutions?  Bitcoin knows you want some.  Bitcoin wants you to make the first move.   Don't be afraid, Bitcoin will treat you right.

tldr; Bitcoin's intraday rally follows a near 36% rise over the past month as traders look to institutional demand to fuel further upside.

CryptoCurrency,(Proof) We have proof that institutions typically do NOT buy crypto during weekends/holidays!,"I have been suspecting for quite a while that institutions typically do **NOT** buy crypto during weekends/holidays.

Usually my comments get downvoted, and people say something like ""surely by now institutions have learnt to buy during weekends"", ""surely they have an intern working on weekends to press the buy button"".

Now we have proof!

>“**This could be an interesting weekend for bitcoin as much of the institutional money is expected to be dormant**,” said **Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda**. “**Weekend volatility has been somewhat of a story this year**, so many crypto watchers will look to see if any whales try to take advantage of illiquid conditions.”    
Source: [https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-ether-all-time-high-bitcoin-stalls](https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-ether-all-time-high-bitcoin-stalls)

Basically, for large institutions, buying crypto is likely not as easy as going to an exchange and pressing the ""buy"" button. Due to the large amount of money involved, there is likely to be multiple legal paperwork that needs to be filed, the big boss needs to approve, etc, all this is best done on a workday, i.e. Monday to Friday.

Even Elon Musk likely needs approval from the board of directors to buy crypto using Tesla's funds. Sure, if he buys using his own money he doesn't need approval, but if he is using company money he does.

# How this information is useful?

This info could be useful because it means that weekend dips are likely due to retail investors selling. It may not mean that institutional money is dumping. Hence, weekend dips are a good opportunity to buy the dip.

Although volume might be less lower than weekends most crypto trades are executed by bots. Spikes are often triggered by human FOMO or panic.

I’d imagine companies use bots to buy, honestly. i.e., it buys BTC every several seconds, and more so when the price dips 2%, 3%, etc. This would keep their average buy-in lower, and allow for flexibility on the balance sheet.

You think Goldman sachs is buying banano soon?

It is unlikely that Elon needs to go to the Tesla board for approval of every crypto purchase.  What they would do is authorize purchase of $XX billion (I'm dreaming) and leave it up to the corporate executive (Elon) to determine how and when to make the purchases.  *...so it's easily possible that even entities with oversight requirements are buying on weekends, if that is to their advantage.*

Unfortunately there's nothing conclusive in this thread, all sorts of people and algorithms buy and sell at different times.

Buy the High, sell the DIPPPP!!!!

Of course not, the 1% don’t work holidays lol.

Well that settles that.🤷🏽‍♀️

CryptoCurrency,BBC News takes consistently bearish position on cryptocurrencies?,"I post this because I live in the UK and the BBC is without doubt the premier news website. Indeed some data suggests that it has [more traffic than any other news site in the world](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/2020/worlds-most-visited-news-site)

The BBC also has a special position in UK law as it is bound by a Royal charter which requires it to remain independent and have politically unbiased coverage of the news as a part of its mission to inform, educate, and entertain. It also has unique funding as UK resident TV licence fees contribute to their income.

It always catches my eye when the BBC News website publishes an article about cryptocurrencies. 15 hours ago they published this article.

[Dogecoin takes off after tip by Elon Musk](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55939854)

Which goes into a lot of detail about the pitfalls of cryptoassets without covering the benefits:

‘However, with no intrinsic value like gold or land, and no ability to generate an income like a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise.

This makes them hard to value and makes their prices susceptible to tips from backers or sudden panics.

Critics point out that while any given cryptocurrency may have a finite supply of units, the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless.

People have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and corrupted or lost hard drives.

Bitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000.

Because the cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated like cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard.

Last month, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets.

The financial watchdog said investors should be ""prepared to lose all their money"" should their investment's value collapse.’

Their previous article on the topic had a similarly doom-mongering headline:

[Cryptoasset investing? Be prepared to lose the lot, warns watchdog](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55615514)

Although the text of the article was more cautionary, warning people of get-rich quick schemes and also potential fraudulent scam activity and I agree this is one aspect of the coverage which is definitely in the public’s interest.

A previous post about [bitcoin reaching its three-year high in November 2020](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54982604) did mention its scarcity as an upside for investment but again mostly focused on the risks and downsides associated with cryptocurrencies:

‘But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility.

""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes.""

Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO).

""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver.

""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" ‘

Of course, I understand that they are reporting this in an independent way and they have a duty not to take a position on long term market value, I feel that the positives of decentralisation, transactional transparency, and technological problem-solving which many cryptocurrencies offer are not covered in as much detail as the risks and downsides.

This has the potential end result of delaying mainstream adoption and making the public distrust the cryptocurrency market outright rather than taking a considered and balanced approach.

How do you think these issues can be tackled? I am a general supporter of the BBC’s news coverage but Surely one of the most widely read and trusted news sources in the world shouldn’t institutionally be a harbinger of so much negativity?

Else the general public don’t get a more complete informed view of this ever-developing field...


TL:DR - The BBC usually has fair and balanced reporting to properly inform the public. They seem to be consistently reinforcing the negatives with cryptocurrencies with limited reporting of the positives. I believe this is presenting an incomplete view to the public and is risking the public being less well informed. How can this be tackled?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ld2nel/bbc_news_takes_consistently_bearish_position_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ld2nel/bbc_news_takes_consistently_bearish_position_on/,36,85,2021-02-05 08:10:32,pippius,"I have a consistently bearish position on the future of bbc

""However, with no intrinsic value like gold or land,""

This is a classic myth and has been answered in multiple FAQ's and papers and here many times.

I feel sorrow for the BBC, for a lot of my life they were a beacon of rationality against a wild and sensationalist British media. 

However over the last 10 years, the Conservatives and right wing media have beaten the impartiality right out of them. 

Cameron and Osborne used to regularly threaten them in public about pulling the license fee if they didn't tow the line, the board has since been stacked with Tory donors, and the new head of is, you guessed it, a massive Tory donor. 

Meanwhile every right leaning media outlet accuses them of extreme left bias, no matter how clear it is that facts show the opposite, and despite grit and determination, they're succumbing to it, moving further and further toward pro Government, pro Conservative opinions. 

They are now, from a news angle anyway, simply an authoritarian state media mouth piece. On other aspects they still produce some great content, but it won't last. Comedy will go, nature documentaries will go, radio is already being slimmed down, cut up, and original content removed in favour of repetition. 

And as always with right wing neoliberal Governments, it's the same path, undermine, de-fund, break apart, privatise.

It is really sad, they were such a fantastic institution Brits could be quietly proud of, but it has been ruined like so so many other things, by pure ideological fantasy. 

Edit: spelling, grammar, sentence structure

I think there's alo an underlying issue with the UK's finalcial regulators (I work im digital banking) as they can be quite hectic in regards to investment news.

Also BBC IS biased, even with the charter, and with their private funding coming kostky from international governments I'd be surprised if they took a pro-crypto sramce at this stage.

Utter lack of understanding the fundamentals. It’s not just a trade-able asset, these blockchain networks have purpose, the value they provide is what you should be assessing, this value generates positive or negative sentiment which affects the demand and with finite supply it affects the price directly. It’s common sense investing but the bbc can’t see that?

It is the same here in the Netherlands. Every news article (and Dutch public television) is not balanced at all. Always comparing it to a big bubble and comparing it to a casino where you will lose all your money. and of-course you should also remember that it is very bad for the environment.. 

I was reading another negative article on bitcoin some time ago on [NU.nl](https://NU.nl) (the biggest online news site in the Netherlands) After I finished the article it says in a very small font: This article is sponsored by the ING bank

Love that they specified the $5K and $9K drops bet left out and of the opposing rises. You can easily see they are listing two “higher lows” which is a bullish signal but how many average readers are going to see that aspect when it is worded to scare you about the massive drops? Certainly seems incredibly biased for a publication that has a government mandate to be independent. Shows crypto is still working towards the “then you win” phase.

#First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win

I noticed it was especially bad during the 2017 bull run. I'd say a lot of it comes from the journalists having no clue what they are writing about.

You ever listen to the Newscast podcast? They have done short pieces on Bitcoin recently and they were mostly positive, whilst still playing their impartiality nonsense.

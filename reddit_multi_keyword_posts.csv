Forex,oanda,My Personal Best,"Sorry if the text of this post doesn't really make sense but I just wanted to post because This moment has been a long time coming. I have 'finally' (i know some people don't ever see this amount of money in the markets) made 1k in a single trade and a single day (24 hours because technically i opened the trade last night). after losing several thousands of dollars over more than half a decade between shitty courses, funded account challenges, and personal trading account loses, I can finally say I have achieved 'The Big One'. To some of you this may seem like peanuts, to others it may be a life changing amount of money, but to me it is proof. Everyone in my life that I have told about my trading has doubted me and said I was making a mistake. While this may be just another trade to some this is about finally overcoming a milestone for me. 

  
With this trade I have been able to prove to myself that trading is a viable option for my future. I know that some of you will say that I am making a mistake by going down this route and that's ok. I am not a full time trader, Calling myself a part time trader might even be a little bit of an overstatement. I have a full time job and a Girlfriend so obviously I am not able to commit as much time as others to this endeavor but this is still a milestone mark for me. this trade is what proved to MYSELF that I am able to do this full time in the future. 

  
If you are able to read a tradingview chart you understand what happened but if not let me explain. I entered a trade for a GBPUSD buy on Monday night (EST) and it ended up in profit but I had moved my SL into profit and I got stopped out a little over 30 pips in profit, but I knew that there was more upward movement coming so I reentered the trade. Maintaining the confidence I had in my original position is what led to this big trade (currently \~250 pips in profit). Sorry for the long winded message, this is more for me than anything but if you have any thoughts, comments, or concerns please don't hesitate to let me know.",https://i.redd.it/3l7smtuow3ue1.png,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jwehdf/my_personal_best/,7,3,2025-04-11 01:38:59,peopleeater23,"Congratulations on this achievment! 

BUT, as i'm sure you know... a single trade does not matter... Sure, you made money.. but if you're losing it over the next few trades, it means nothing.

What matters is the outcome of 100 or 1000 trades combined.

Please update us at the end of the year i really hope you're consistent at execution and at managing risk.

That will be a very good post!

good job and keep at it, can't wait for more updates.

So how did u caught up this big trade ? is it S/R?  I m usually afraid of long trades especially nowadays. and tyy"
Forex,oanda,Progress towards Prop Firm Challenge,"So I've been trading awhile on my algo on Oanda live with my own money, which has been successful, but my boss (who also trades forex) suggested I do a prop firm challenge since if I can get funded, then I'll be able to make a higher return faster. I trade strictly by algo, but he trades manually, but I was able to create an indicator for him that helped with his strategy that got him funded this past week.

Me, I blew up 3 free demo accounts with the prop firm last week, just figuring out their broker's api plus the tariff nonsense. I'm happy to say that this week I've managed to stay profitable every single day without even going close to the DD limit after I made some adaptations to my risk management logic.

Anyway, I attached a pic of my equity curve you can see on the 100k demo account. If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer.

Some changes I made:

\* Dropped my nominal volume to $400.00 per position

\* Set my TP on entry based on the entry price (see if i can get a quick nab), wait 30s, then set TP based on DCA price

\* Block USDZAR, USDTHB from trading

\* Trust my algo, never prune winners or losers early

  
\*\*Disclaimer\*\*:

Not trying to sell an algo or advertise or anything, mostly just wanted to share my progress towards my goal of a funded account and to encourage people to not give up. Takes a lot of retooling to stay within prop firm rules while also staying realistically profitable! I feel proud with the progress I've had and I'll update you guys once I buy a challenge.",https://i.redd.it/w4xqtb81ayte1.png,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jvrcng/progress_towards_prop_firm_challenge/,5,19,2025-04-10 06:29:32,Fold-Plastic,"It appears this thread is about Prop Firms and Scouting Programs.

I find this incredibly neat upward trend highly unbelievable.

can't edit the op for some reason, but rereading the sub rules I'll give a little more detail.

should be obvious but this is a scalping algo trading 15 usd pairs on the 10 min. $400 nominal volume per entry, TP 0.02%. normally fills a smidge over the tp price and $3-4 per win after fees.

I don't have numbers on trades per day but it's something like 50-100.

How is the risk managed?

First of all congratulations bro u are in top 5 percent and second of all tell me the setup😭"
Forex,oanda,I caught this masterpiece entry on Gold. 1.5% return.,"Reasoning: Gold has been extremely bullish these past few months. Every time it settles on a new All Time High it has a slight pattern of retracing into a weekly FVG b4 reversing back upward and making a new All Time High. Price was overall bullish on the weekly but was retracing and with a simple look at the chart I already had a damn good idea where price wanted to go which was the most recent weekly FVG and also the only FVG within that bullish extension, so I wanted to enter in there. I watched as price slowly targetted the weekly FVG and the asian session eventually tapped into it, but I still waited. Off the power of 3 rule I naturally assumed that another session(presumably the new york session) would sweep back the old asian session low and give me deeper contact in the weekly FVG. I waited to the next day and the New York session gave me exactly just that. I entered off a 15 minute break of structure and targetted previous session highs. I set my stop below the weekly FVG and my Take profit at a past London high. I risked 1.5% to gain 1.5% roughly. I then waited around a day and half for my Take profit to get hit. I basically betted that I was catching Gold in its rebalancing/pullback act. All on demo btw to be clear. Just experimenting.",https://i.redd.it/3x4w6usjxste1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jv4hv9/i_caught_this_masterpiece_entry_on_gold_15_return/,17,1,2025-04-09 12:25:11,Hour_Ant323,Genuinly could have held this position from anywhere to a few weeks to a few months as long as Gold kept rising.
Forex,oanda,OB Strategy can't be a main one?,"Hi guys, I am still relatively new to trading I guess, so please forgive me for any mistakes here and there. 

Starting off with the topic then:   
My main strategy for entering any position is through Order Block zones, I draw them only when I consider them valid i.e. BOS, Inefficiency/FVG, (I still need to incorporate Breaker Blocks, but for now normal OB are fine).  


Entries are variable but for the sake of this post let's say as soon as price hits OB, enter trade, with SL a few pips above OB, TP is 3R/4R depending on the market. 

I do not expect this to be a bullet proof strategy but there are times where market will not respect these key zones over and over again, making it an absolute bloodbath. 

  
What other confluence should I consider? or should I just ditch this completely?

  
Image: 

90% of the OB are on the 5 minutes time frame with 1/2 on the 15 minute. 

the **RED** indicate failed OB.

the **GREEN** indicate respected OB.

the **GREY** indicate price did not tap in the zone. 

the **Purple**, ignore it.

",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jupay8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jupay8/ob_strategy_cant_be_a_main_one/,6,8,2025-04-08 21:36:45,C0untingNightmares,"You are disappearing down a rabbit hole. A very colourful one, but nonetheless. If you get half those words out of your vocabulary you will do better. The idea of understanding where people have set their stops/orders is not bad, this FVG and all those other made up terms are meaningless. individual candles have no meaning, since their appearance would completely change if they were offset by 50%, while the price movement would be exactly the same.

A strategy can only ""work"" once you apply money management rules. Otherwise you're just doing a bunch of nothing. Gambling perhaps.

So your saying price action is bullshit?

Single candle stuff, yes

Ahaa so how do you trade?"

Yea I’d say that’s a huge selling point if you’re on really short duration trades. If you’re a swinger than a few pips aren’t gunna kill the move.

both suck for leverage-CFD, unless you are from the USA

true, but 2 pips draw down from the get go on multiple lots vs basically 0 drawdown is still a difference :)"

They have Daily interest payments to fund your position as well as borrowing (leverage) and swaps (Riba).

Don't 'eid mubarak' anyone.

I like this setup. Break the high low , then wait for a lower low. If that happens, we’ve got ourselves a nice bullish opportunity.

Don't tell the OP what to do 🤣

Buddy, you have no data to suggest it will go higher than 3085. You can only be confident with zone setups like these that price will return to a level it has reached before. You setting some arbitrary R:R level assumes you know how the market will play out, which you can’t. Your SL is way too tight, too. What if it closes above your zone for a few candles then briefly dips below SL? Trading gold that would be a big L. If I were you, unless I have real data showing me otherwise, I’d set TP to 3085 and get rid of your SL (if you’re even using one)

Most of the time brokers take an Admin fee instead of swaps (interest) on Islamic accounts. But that admin fee tends to be very similar in price price to swaps (from what I’ve seen) 😂

Brokers don’t care, they’re in the business of maximising profits not helping people adhere to their religions. Sadly"

Forex,oanda,Confused about Prop Firm profitability,"Hey guys, been researching Forex for a few months. Primarily understanding price action, general market analysis, and have been using TradingView's basic plan to perform basic backtesting. I also have a background in mathematics so I'm not confused by ideas that arise from risk management and long term profitability.


I have been planning out how to foray into starting trading, but prop firms seem to be utterly impossible to make work? I've only deep dived on Oanda, so I will be referencing their structure.


Let me run through an example. A trader buys a challenge, where they are provided a virtual account with $100,000 for $599. 10% max dynamic drawdown and 5% dynamic daily drawdown. Phase 1 needs 8% profit. Phase 2 needs 5% profit. Total of 13% profit. 


To adhere with risk management, their real account size is effectively $10,000 (drawdown). To ensure natural variance doesn't kick their ass, 1% risked for each trade is a solid idea, therefore, $100 risked. By itself, that's awesome. If the trader could take immediate profits that is an easy $599 -> $10,000. From here on, I reference the eventual funded account as being $10,000, as that is the $$ available to the trader.


Now how can a trader actually become funded? 


If we take an example edge, let's say 1:2 risk:return, with a 40% winrate, the traders expected value is (0.40x0.02-0.60x0.01) = 0.002. i.e. over a large sample size they will make a return of 0.2% of their max drawdown each trade. That's $20EV for a goal of $13,000 before being able to take profit. It should be noted that a 40% accuracy is pretty god damn high when the true breakeven is 33.3%



This is utterly ludicrous haha. Sure, I think once you become funded and can make a withdrawal of minimum $200, that's a reasonable way to start (for $599 too!). But it would take a risk-conscious trader $13,000/$20 = 650 trades to become funded.


I have other ideas, such as implementing a higher risk:reward for the short-term. I wrote a python script which simulated the results of and it seemed possible that you could up the risk:reward to something like 10% of max drawdown to 20% of max drawdown, but I didn't have time to get very far into my analysis. Off the top of my head you could get 30% - 60% of your attempts funded with various scales of accuracy and risk:reward of max drawdown.


Further than that, let's say you do your best and keep trying. Even if a riskier strategy provides a 50% chance to fund an account, it's not unreasonable for you to fail 3+ times at those odds. Every fail is $599. $599 of your eventual $10,000 account is 5.9%. That's approximately two to six months of trading (given a reasonable expectation of around 1% - 5% return per month).


Can someone provide insights into what I am currently considering? 


Feel free to disagree with my math as well, I'd love feedback on it.

Edit: changed EV calc as it italicized from the *",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j57fyd/confused_about_prop_firm_profitability/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j57fyd/confused_about_prop_firm_profitability/,0,5,2025-03-06 22:02:19,FruitFliesLikeBonana,"It appears this thread is about Prop Firms and Scouting Programs. [**A detailed overview and comparison of popular forex prop firms can be found here.**](https://volatility.red/Trader_Scouting_and_Prop_Firms_Overview_and_Comparison)      


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Forex) if you have any questions or concerns.*

The equation I use to determine prop firm risk per trade is max drawdown / my max losing streak across x data… and then I reduce it a bit. In this case if a trader doesn’t often see a 10R drawdown in their trading then it is worth them risking 1% on a prop account. The ROI can be huge!

Of course if you often lose 20R (would be crazy imo) then you can risk 0.5% and still get a very good ROI.

It’s not a personal account and it doesn’t cost the same as a personal account which has the same buying power in the market would, so there’s no reason to risk only 1% of the max drawdown.

A simple look at your trading strategy data over a year would tell you all you need to know in order to optimise your prop firm risk management for max ROI.

You need $62.5 a day with 100K account to get funded in 1 year. That’s 2 x Nas100 scalps a day with like 2.5 lots targetting 15 points or one trade with 5 lots. That can be made at NY open with a little bit of daily prayers easily.

Forex,oanda,How many of you are algo traders?,"I've been algo trading stocks and crypto for a few years, and while I've traded forex before, it's only been the last few months I've really focused on forex specifically because of the leverage and because my boss is really into it though he hand trades, doesn't use algos.

I have to admit this has been working gangbusters for me though! trading 16 pairs fully auto and just making little tweaks here and there to inch up my daily return. I honestly feel like this market is way better than stocks and crypto.

My technical set up is tv webhooks to a python server to Oanda, and I livechart all my results in Google sheets also automatically which is fun to watch while I work at my desk.

I'm curious how many of you are also deploying algos? and what's your technical set up look like?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j18vco/how_many_of_you_are_algo_traders/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j18vco/how_many_of_you_are_algo_traders/,5,12,2025-03-01 20:25:22,tat_tvam_asshole,"Look into r/algotrading . I do both live trading and algo trading at low volumes whilst I test my strategy and finesse the code. I too have a TV pinescript API call setup into fxcm, but plan to upgrade this to a more sophisticated ML python solution through Visual studio code and API connections with brokers. I've been working on my master strategy for a couple years now and am pretty happy with it, barring some tweaks needed to risk management side. And also in midst of changing brokers as I've qualified for a pro level account with 1000:1 leverage and super tight spreads with IC Markets.

U can also use the Python bridge in mt5. I did work on pattern recognition (it would look at certain formation of swing low/high patterns and other indicators) hooked up to  mongodb and it was mildly successful. The biggest drawback of algo trading is making it understand the' change in regime'. The work that we did encompassed creating entirely different modules in signal generation, risk management, order management, portfolio risk management etc. Risk was a big part of it. Project is on hold for now, we are looking to take up on it once this learning model expert comes on board.

Ps oanda didn't provide any tick data, they have a limit on how many API calls u can make on their restful API.

Have you tried writing the code only by ChatGPT? I found for my strategy it somehow cannot debug its own code (python).

I completely understand you, I was into coding algos for futures but that was a mess of its own. 

Like someone else here said, creating algos ironically has became my trading income alongside trading itself. 
I’ve tried to deploy with python but I now heavily rely on mql4 and mql5 strictly. I’ve learned to transfer code between the two.

Currently running 3 pairs,

•Gold
•GbpJpy
•Eurusd

Averaging about 0.28% daily.

Regime change isn't difficult to detect/code, ime. I just use Oanda as a broker, not for data, and I trade 30min candles so API limit isn't a huge deal breaker anyway.

Not sure if 4.5k is a lot of money to you or not, but if it is, I would look at what I’m risking per trade. Personally never risk more than 1% of trading account, an on funded accounts I risk 0.25 % - 0.5% per trade. 

Also if you see massive swings in your performance, that’s probably because of luck. A slow, steady curve will mostly indicate good practice. Good luck mate.

If you have to ask this then no you are not doing it right… forex isn’t supposed to be wild gambling, you make a trade once per day when you are 100% sure of your set up and your stop loss and take profit decides if you were correct or not

Additionally you have 8 losses and only 3 wins, each trade is its own set up so I’d assume that’s over 2 weeks (if it’s not you need to readdress  
your trading plan) also at the very least you are not winning 50% of your trades and that means your entry timing or chart pattern reading is wrong"

Forex,oanda,(Help) mobile trading with Oanda,"So I’ve put a little money in an Oanda account. I tried a couple of small trades just to see how operating MT4 was with a live account. Let me tell you! It is NOT the same as a demo account I practiced with on MT5. I like to just take market orders, but I could not close the one trade that was in profit as (I could only gather)  it was out of order in which it was placed. I was able to close them all out in a different order than they were placed. Which forced me to realize losses on some of the trades. 
Then out of frustration with that, I linked to TradingView to try that, all seemed fine aside from the fact that I couldn’t trade a typical lot size, it wanted my total quantity! WTH! 

Are these common problems? Easily fixable? Do people just live with them? 

I don’t know anyone who trades, so I’m sort of alone in this. May be having a rough day too, so I’ve resorted to just trying to ask you fine folks.

Forex,oanda,Advice on currency pairs for SMC,"Hi everyone, I'm new to FX trading and using a paper money account to develop some strategies. I'm studying these so called ""Smart Money Concepts"" of looking at market structure, liquidity, and order blocks to try to follow institutional moves (largely based on concepts from YouTubers Photon Trading / Matt Donlevey and Fortune Talks). I began by watching Jason Graystone's content but was constantly getting stopped out, so I found these liquidity concepts interesting.

  
Anyway, I'm having a hard time identifying which currency pairs to trade. USD-based pairs have the highest volume, but they're all obviously tied to the performance of USD. So, I believe there's a huge correlation risk if just trading the USD pairs. Some of the pairs (NZD/CHF) are extremely low volume and have quite choppy price action. I mostly use 1D as my higher timeframe and 1H as my trading timeframe, sometimes looking at 15min for confirmation. 5min has burned me too many times so far.

  
What advice do you all have about selecting which currency pairs to monitor and trade? All of the major currency pairs is too overwhelming for me. I have a hard time assessing the true trading volume; Google indicates EUR/USD is the highest volume pair, but I rarely see it having the highest volume displayed in TradingView (Oanda is my broker).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1itsokb/advice_on_currency_pairs_for_smc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1itsokb/advice_on_currency_pairs_for_smc/,3,3,2025-02-20 07:08:43,Expwy,"Forex is a decentralized market, there’s no way to know the true volume information like you can with stocks or futures. I wouldn’t rely on any strategy that involves volume for Forex due to this.

Also, you do you, but personally I recommend staying away from SMC stuff. It’s overly-complicated and for no added benefit, is also based on a lot of overly-simplistic incorrect assumptions about how markets work, and is often created and peddled by scammers and fraudsters. 

Price action & market structure are IMO the best place to start as a trader. Tradeciety is a good resource for that type of stuff, but there are plenty of other sources out there.

If you’re day trading then just pick a few pairs that aren’t too correlated. Perhaps EURUSD and GBPJPY, or something like that. You can honestly even get away with only one pair as a day trader. 

If you’re swing trading, then you’ll probably want at least 3 pairs, if not more, to monitor since setups will be less frequent.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply. It's interesting what you say about SMC. I started to explore it as a response to my stops getting blown out and then price going in the direction I was essentially trading anyway. Do you have experience with that, or advice on avoiding that scenario? Do you look at areas where there might be a lot of liquidity built up and place your stop losses beyond those, or do you ignore liquidity concepts entirely? I could just set wider stop losses too of course. I realize that at the end of the day it's all about establishing a firm set of rules that work for me.

  
And noted regarding the pairs, thanks for that. I've actually had good results with GBP/JPY over time. Right now I mostly swing trade as I still have a day job, although my goal is to eventually support myself by trading.

You’re welcome. Yeah it’s a common thing traders do in the beginning, feels like every trade singles you out personally just to take your stop and then take off. But that’s not what’s actually happening. 

I don’t use liquidity concepts, no. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/s/uhl86p09bH) awhile back regarding some things that can happen to inexperienced traders that can make it *feel* like the market is out to get them (when it’s not), and some possible basic solutions. You can take a look at that if you’d like. It’s essentially just being out-of-synch with the waves of the market."

First of all, most people choose brokers for a good trading environment & spreads, such as IG, ICmarket, Vantage

Secondly, most people use trading tools such as MT4/MT5/tradingview/ctrader which need to be linked to brokers, which provide charts that allow traders to clearly know the direction of the market.

Bullish

You don't trade based on what you think. You trade based on what you see, and what you see is how the market plays out.   
  
It could be -   
  
1) uptrend because global yield is rising and JPY depreciates  
2) JPY appreciates because we are on a risk off environment. 

3) GBP depreciates because of growth concerns in the UK economy.

Forex,oanda,Problems with insufficient margin,"I mostly trade GBP/USD on TradingView and I use Oanda as my broker, but often times when I try to risk 2-3% of my account, it doesn’t let me. I have a small account of around $500, and my trades only get approved if I risk around 1% of my account. Can someone explain to me what I’m missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1ifpfhf/problems_with_insufficient_margin/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1ifpfhf/problems_with_insufficient_margin/,5,5,2025-02-02 04:41:48,Astreum98,"Margin requirements come from two things:

(1) the leverage of the pair

(2) the size of your trade (in units/lots)

For (1), GBPUSD’s leverage is 20:1, one of the lowest leverages offered, meaning the margin requirements are higher for this pair.

For (2), the lower the timeframe you trade on, the less pips you’re typically risking. This means you need *more* size to get the same risk, which increases the margin requirements further.

So, there are a number of things you can do. You can either:

-be okay with risking less than you want

-add more money to your account to cover the margin required

-trade a different pair with a higher leverage, for example a 50:1 pair like EURUSD or USDCAD

-move up a timeframe or two (like if you’re trading on the 1min, try the 5min, etc) and/or widen your SL to risk more pips and thus reduce your trade size, lowering the margin required

1. there's nothing wrong with a small account balance. You just need to understand that returns, while using sustainable risk practices... won't be significant.
2. You need to learn how leverage works in the markets.

Your forex broker offers a leverage of (likely) 1:50 or 1:100...

Now when does that come in to play? when you're trading small stop loss values... 3..4..5 pips. Why? because to risk 1..2 or idk 3 % of your capital over 5 pips, that requires an unusually large LOT size for your account size...

while if you're risking the same % of capital but over 30pips, that size is MUCH smaller.

So if you're really going for opening ""large positions"" with tight stops, just go for a higher leverage account.. 1:500 or something close to that spectre will do.

Do i think you should? Deffinitely not.

probably you dont have enough leverage.

You can trade a little more with eurusd but those rules are good for you. Don’t really want to be risking so much

What you're missing is called Risk Management"

I agree, stop loss to breakeven as soon as logically possible in my opinion. Looks like was up 2r or so surely stops goes to break even or partials are took

You have the right idea. Def drop the BBs. Focus on the daily, I love that you have the patience to see how the daily plays out to gain confidence. I do something similar. I wait for daily sentiment/momentum, and scale down to 1hr. What do you mean by can’t test anything?

I'm not seeing any direction out there on the daily charts, looks like I will wait after the Fridays data.

I'm more of a discretionary trader the idea behind these trades is avoiding this week altogether feels mixed all week but it's hard for me to find confidence bc I can't test anything my idea is to be a fundamental discretionary trader and I want to use daily chart only and fixed stop of 160 pips and large targets 700 800 1200 pips I'm planning to start live trading this year so I need all the feedback I can get.

I'm not sure I have anything to back test being discretionary. I want to flow with the market with my entries and using stop loss fixed at 160 and large tp. My edge would be risk reward my judgement and trading off data & currency strength weakness... That's all I have to work with. Longer term swing trading leaning closer to position trader."

OP look out for tariff news, and upcoming FOMC and what daddy J is going to say about the whole situation, any hints about further rate cuts/hikes or no cuts at all.

Ohkay thanks I appreciate it

Hahaha just because you think that Trumps victory will change how dollar and gold work will. Its basic fundamentals for gold that it is treated as a safe haven, so no matter who the president of USA will be Gold will always be inversely proportional to US dollar.

Draw liquidity zones from the daily/4hr/1hr/30/15min. In that order and then see which ones have confluence (match), then wait for price to get close or enter in those zones and look for a reversal candle, then set your tp to the nearest liquidity zone and sl below/above the liquidity zone you placed your trade. Once you get comfortable trading this way you can open multiple positions letting one of them ride to second nearest liquidity zone.

Forex,oanda,Getting off the 1 minute chart,"Seeking advice!

I’ve been trading the 1 minute EUR/JPY chart for around 6 months with a $200 Oanda account, never allowing more than a $2 loss.

Unfortunately, as a substitute teacher in California, I’m restricted to scalping during the Tokyo session.

I’d like to begin transitioning into higher time frames, but don’t feel I know how. 

I’d rather make 1 or two trades a day, check in on them once or twice, and not be trapped in the scalping headspace.

How should I begin working up?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1hxhpva/getting_off_the_1_minute_chart/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1hxhpva/getting_off_the_1_minute_chart/,0,21,2025-01-09 17:12:33,Pipesandboners,"Might be quite the change, and obviously you can stick to day trading if it works better for you but you could also consider swing trading. 

I used to day trade the 5min chart, but a little over a year ago I transitioned to swing trading. I do my analysis on the daily and execute on the 4hr. Took some getting used to for sure, and I changed my strategy (not always required) to one better suited to passive trading. 

Now I do all my analysis and set alerts near my setups from my PC on the weekend. Once price hits an alert throughout the week, I’ll check it on my phone (from wherever I am). 

If I like it, I’ll set a pending order (limit or stop order depending on the situation) and so then if price truly reaches my setup, it’ll get me in automatically without me being on the chart. Then I’ll set alerts to let me know when the trade reaches certain points so I don’t have to keep checking it.

This makes it so that I only spend up to 2-3 hours total per *week* on trading related stuff, including weekend analysis and journaling (which takes the most time). And my schedule is very flexible. Before, I spent 2-3 hours per *day* on trading, and had to be actively on the chart at the same time everyday.

I was a similar way, I work 9-5 so it made trading really difficult without being by my phone/laptop all day to monitor. 

I would still trade in the Asian if that’s working for you, but look for setups on the 4h or 1h with the strategy you’re currently using and see how it works on a demo. Might need some tweaking for the higher time frame, just backtest and see what happens. 

That’s the same reason I learned to code and just wrote my strategies as an algo, so I don’t ever have to touch my laptop (which is nice 🤣). 

Good luck!

1. Making 1 or 2 traders per day is not going to align with your ""check once or twice"" idea... Just to enter that, you'll need to invest A LOT of screen time.  A setup is there, when it gets there.. Not when you want it to get there.

2. Living in california can be pretty expensive, no? So let's say one can consistently make 10-20 % gain per annum (realistic goals)....  you'd need what? 500k in capital at least, just to live a decent life, rigt? Just something to think about for the future

Google no nonsense forex. That strategy is exactly what you are describing. He has a you tube channel that goes over the strategy in extreme detail.

Aside from looking for new strategies/setups, one thing you might have difficulty in is how much you can risk. At higher timeframes, the possible drawdown is much higher than at lower timeframes. You will probably need to decrease your lot size significantly. On the flip side, you're also aiming for increased pip gains. Just to give an idea, it's like halving your lot size, but doubling your TP, works out to be about the same, but usually with swing trades you aim for a bit higher.

This means that, at least in the beginning, it's quite possible that one swing trade is earning you a bit over one of your current scalp trades. You will eventually aim for higher returns as you get a better feel for the market, so don't let this discourage you.

The other thing you should take into account are swap fees. These either work for you or against you, but they are definitely something you should be considerate of if your starting capital is small."

If the winning strategy brings in any money, call it whateva u like mate😜

Your strategy is essentially a ""Smart Money Concept (SMC) + Price Action + Fibonacci"" approach, but there isn’t a widely recognized single name for it. As the other comment said, you get the privilege to name it :)

Out of Curiosity, how much have you made SHORTING gold vs LONG this year?  

I mean, are the bulk of your winning trades LONG or SHORT.  

We have been in an insane Gold Rush for a while now, the strategy might be called: A BULL MARKET

I’d call it a reversal strategy."

I’d like to hear from experts on how I can further refine this approach. I’m also curious to know how others use Anchored VWAP in their strategies.

Take the loss and learn. It could go back up or it could go much lower. Now you're gambling. Hope isn't a trading strategy. Trust me I've been there.

Trading,oanda,The interesting world of Japanese FX brokers.,"Hello there!

Well since I live in Japan I thought it might be interesting for some people to learn a bit about how a very particular but fairly big FX market functions for retail traders. First of all here in Japan, you have to choose between the domestic brokers which I'll talk about because they're quite interesting compared to brokers you see around online, and the ""overseas"" broker which are allowed but barely (it's more like tolerated). In fact, many brokers are not available to Japan residents because they don't want to potentially deal with Japanese authorities. The ones that do, (there are like a dozen I think?) are often regulated in Seychelles or Mauritius like XMTrading, ICMarkets Global, HFM etc. So we still have the choice, unlike US traders who are banned everywhere unfortunately. Few foreign brokers try to open up shop domestically. Notable names are Saxo Bank, Forex.com, Oanda and Dukascopy however.  
Anyway, I want to provide a glimpse into purely Japanese FX brokers because they offer trading conditions that might make your jaw drop, especially on YEN pairs.  


So we have big names like GMO, Minna no FX, Rakuten (which is also present in Australia), DMM or even LINE (yes the message application). They actually advertise fairly aggressively. I always hear about DMM FX or CFD in local convenience stores for example. Regulation is pretty tight, however and leverage is low (I think it's max 1:25 on major pairs). Landing on their home page is advertising no commissions whatsoever. OK so you might think that spreads are at least like 0.9 pips right?? Well no. USD/JPY notably is often advertised as having 0.2 pip only! Same (0.2) for the highly exotic MXN/JPY who rose in popularity due to the carry trade, something you'll NEVER find anywhere else... And the carry trade is often highly advertised, ""We have the best swaps!"" they say. This is because they cater to the famous ""Mrs Watanabe"" traders who just carry trade -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Watanabe  
Also one peculiar thing is that they often do not have Metatrader and rely on their own platforms. Some do advertise Metatrader though or more recently, tradingview.  
Another curious thing is Minna no FX for example advertising ""BIG lots up to 300 allowed""! Damn, some people must be balling!   Some even have really low spreads on EUR/USD or AUD/USD like 0.3. It's really surprising for a 0 commission account. Who knows, maybe it would be interesting for day trading or even scalping as this would be very very low cost.
I am not sure if those domestic FX brokers are market makers, STP or ECN. This is not really something they advertise but the fact that they're regulated in Japan make them extremely safe, generally speaking.

There you go, a glimpse into the local FX offering. I'm sure those are trading conditions that aren't found anywhere else tbh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1frb30t/the_interesting_world_of_japanese_fx_brokers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1frb30t/the_interesting_world_of_japanese_fx_brokers/,7,7,2024-09-28 10:08:41,romjpn,"This looks like a newbie/general question that we've covered in our [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/wiki/index) - Have a look at the contents listed, it's updated weekly!

Hi, I don't live in Japan, but just out of curiosity, could you tell me something about the Fintokey prop company? It was born from the Purple Trading broker and after Japan, they are expanding their business in Italy and Eastern Europe. They claim to be very popular in Japan but it is difficult for me to find reviews from Japanese users. Thanks

[removed]

Honestly it's hard for me to say anything because you literally just made me discover them. I can't find anything blatantly bad about them when taking a look at what is said on X from a few Japanese users.  
Their instant accounts are cool though.

The COVID years were absolutely insane for this strategy, especially MXN/JPY longs but right now the cycle is turning back into JPY strength so it's time to downsize the position or close all of them."

No, not in the US. Things like gold, oil, indices etc are not allowed on Forex brokers because where you’ve seen them on these brokers they’re CFDs, and CFDs aren’t allowed in the US. Forex brokers here only offer spot Forex trading, ie real Forex trading.

If you want to trade gold, oil, indices, etc then you have to trade futures with a futures broker like AMP, Tradovate, etc. 

Some CFD to futures symbol conversions are: Gold/XAUUSD = GC or MGC, Oil/USOIL = CL or MCL, US100/NAS100 = NQ or MNQ, US500/SPX500 = ES or MES, US30/DJI30 = YM or MYM (M stands for micro, ie the smaller contracts)

If trading index’s, why not use a broker that gives you access to futures and move away from CFD’s and their nuances.

Of course my short position from yesterday is already closed at a small plus ! So now here I am looking for some short candlestick like shooting star or engulfing candle.It will also be good if we look at the five-minute chart where we want to see a break of the 1900 level, then a retest. The target of this move is to be the bottom of this range ,namely 1885,and we are likely to make a big wick down ,because there is a lot of news today! I am not a financial advisor ! Good luck!

Maybe it's just building up enough juice to break through?

Or maybe the price of the gold doesn't change and the USD does?

the fact that gold is now making a break above 1904 does not mean that it will not go down to 1885 to skim liquidity.As I wrote before around 1900$ I expect manipulation.But so far we have not had a short signal !!!

I don't follow gold so I just checked. It had a wick up a couple hours ago which looks like a failure. But it hasn't broke down yet either.

USD has broke out so far today but the day is not over so it could end at a wick out as well. Needs another day. It does look strong though."
Trading,oanda,XAUUSD," 

Hello guys, I continue to be sick, but as you know money never sleeps or rests. This is gold 1H timeframe. We broke above the trendline with multiple green candles, but the bulls continue to be weak, unable to overcome the 1904 level. After seeing that the bulls have no intention to make a breakout and a shooting star followed I opened my short position (second picture). Now here the options are two .One is to continue the strong down trend by breaking 1885 and continue to 1870.The second option is to take the stops at the triple bottom below and then start a 4hr retest which will take us to 1955 prices. So far, the market sentiment continues to be bearish!

Let say you have a bot that works well when back test since 2021 until now but not good since 2019 or 2020. Is this a good bot? Will we try to build a bot and back test that bot from time T in the past until now with T as long as possible.

2. Do you fixed spread when back test?

Spread will affect price you buy or sell, then how it should be handled when back test your strategy. I should used fixed spread or not while back test my strategy.

3. Can data to back test be used between markets?

For my case, I download data gold price from Oanda and back tests my strategy using python, when I finish, I can only trade on Exness (I don't have account to trade on Oanda for some reasons). If my bot works on Oanda, can I say it will work on Exness too? Can I use Oanda data to calculate the signal for buying, selling in Exness because I only have API to download data from Oanda.

Note: I know all these questions can be answered by trying but it's better to hear from someone who already tried it. Glad to hear from you sharing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/14ehi4h/how_do_you_back_test_your_bot/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/14ehi4h/how_do_you_back_test_your_bot/,1,5,2023-06-20 17:34:52,AWiselyName,"/r/algoTrading old threads and wiki, 1000s of threads about this

I spent 3 years back testing it on several different exchanges and found that when I started forward testing it, my results were entirely different and not as predictable or profitable as the back tests show.

Since that lesson, I only use forward testing now but on multiple demo accounts so I can aggregate large amounts of data quickly to analyze the process.

I do backtesting on cleo.finance. There are 2 backtesting tools automated and manual. I mostly use automated. You create your bot and backtest it, there are some useful statistics and you can also replay your position history on the chart. Plus you can also include the transaction costs funding fees, commissions, and slippage."
Trading,oanda,What’s the reason most of you are failures at trading? And why do you keep doing it if you think 90% will never be profitable over time? Let me learn from your mistakes.,"I’m an amateur. I used a demo account for six months, watched hundreds of hours of videos and taken courses. Ive been growing my live account 10-25% a week for a few months simply doing what I’ve been taught and sticking to the rules. 

I trade forex CFD through oanda. 2-5 trades a day. 50:1 leverage. 

I’m waiting for something to change, waiting for failure because there are so many of you that say you’ve been trading for 10 years and you’re  breaking even. 

Why are you loosing? Are you getting greedy? Do you not have risk management plan ? How did you blow up your account? How did you loose so many trades in a row? 
Did you force trades?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/11icdlg/whats_the_reason_most_of_you_are_failures_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/11icdlg/whats_the_reason_most_of_you_are_failures_at/,7,25,2023-03-04 20:32:43,Tommothygun,"I’ve been an amateur for 8 years. There’ve been times when I was doing so well for so long I severely cut my hours or even quit my day job, but then I have a few surprises and/or get greedy and trade on hood instead of signals. The only times I’ve lost a lot of money are times when I got too emotional and ignored all the sense my brain was trying to impress upon me. 

So yeah, got greedy and didn’t stick to rules. We’re emotional beings.

And congratulations on growing your account! It’s a beautiful thing when a plan comes together. If you’re doing well with what works for you, don’t fix what ain’t broken.

It’s all blowing smoke until you trade through a black swan event.

Risk management, FOMO, revenge trading, not sticking to rules. Thats why most fail. There are multiple of strategies that work, people just cant deal with the drawdowns and/or cant deal with the “I’m good at this! I should do MORE!” Thoughts. Get greedy, blow accounts.

The inability to change. Anyone can learn price action and technical analysis (seriously, simple concept you can teach a grade schooler) but fighting the urge to do something you know you shouldn’t is everybody’s struggle. You can’t teach discipline, you can only do it. (If that makes any sense).

Do you have any advice, what book to read or what videos to watch? I am just starting out with trading and want to really know what I'm doing before putting my money onto the line. Thanks in advance!"
Trading,oanda,GOLD - 2023 Price Targets,"Hello Traders,

Here is my prediction for GOLD and its target levels for 2023.

First off, I believe GOLD will be one of the best performing assets in 2023. With GOLD being a safety play during economic hardship, and the strong possibility of a recession, we should see GOLD outperform the broader market like in past recessions.

So how high will GOLD go in 2023?

GOLD will likely make new All Time Highs in 2023, potentially as early as the end of the 1st quarter. We could potentially see the price of GOLD rise as much as 20% next year.

Keep in mind we will have pullbacks along the way as price hits resistance levels on the way up, with he most significant level being the prior highs at just over $2,000. We could potentially see price initially pullback sharply off the prior highs then consolidate for weeks before breaking out.

How to trade GOLD?

You will want to enter a GOLD position on a pullback into technical support, not when experiencing FOMO after a monster move. Be patient and wait for the right setup to occur. There will be many rejections at resistance on the way up, where price will have to pullback or consolidate before the next move up. These types of scenarios present the best opportunity for a wing trade in GOLD.

Thanks Everyone

Ask your broker on what they are basing the their marging interest rates. It could be Libor for example that changes all the time.

I have trading for the past 9 months it was all good. Until they change the rollover rate within a night. So all my holding position are now paying swap fee. 

My question was is it legal firm them to change from 1.4% to -5.40%. the Fed hasn't changed the interest rate yet. What is the underlying motive ? Uk Russia war ? But how ? It looks like they just roll the dice and switch the rate trapping most traders like now being on the wrong side."

1st year - $72 a day off 5 Pips = $18,792 + $3,477 (original balance) = $22,269

2nd year beginning balance $22,269 x 50 leverage = $1,113,450 = $556 (5 pips a day) x 261 days

= $145,116 + $22,269 (previous balance) = $167,385 

3rd year beginning balance of $167,385 x 50 leverage = $8,369,250 = $4,184 (5 pips a day) x 261 days = $1,092,024 + $167,385  (previous balance) = $1,259,409

Only way you’ll fail is if you quit

Do not think about compounding pips. 
Measure your stop loss and equate that to One percent (or 2 or 5, if you are a cowboy). That will dictate your leverage. On forex, one percent risk per trade will use approx 10 to 1 max leverage on most trades. Do the numbers.

Don't think about days on days. 

Just know, if you can do 3 percent a month, every month for five years and longer (that's 42 a year compounded monthly), you are a Bonafide star.

If you can do 6 percent a month, you are a Legend.

Never listen to morons who think a small acct grows faster. All accts are the same size, when you are talking about less then 25 million.

All the best.

It looks like you’re compounding yearly not daily... also 5 pips on $3,477*50=$86 not $72? Also doesn’t look like you’re factoring in leverage costs unless your 5 pips is net

Edit: also 50x leverage can go really wrong way really quickly

haha thanks

Thanks for all the corrections. Yeah its based off compounding yearly and it would be 5 pips net. I always use a stop. By any chance do you know what the odds are of not getting your order filled?"

Trading,oanda,Help a newbie out?,"Very new to trading here and have been trying my hand at the paper trading feature on tradingview and have been enjoying it so far. 

I was wondering if anybody can suggest any of the brokers that are connected to tradingview and which would be best for trading things like BTC/USD and XRP/USD. I’m unsure on whether that would be considered forex trading, futures trading or options. I’ve tried to look up definitions and I believe trading bitcoin or XRP against the US dollar would be considered forex, is that correct? If that’s the case, would anyone suggest oanda? 

I’ve tried making demo accounts for a few of the brokers but couldn’t figure out for the life of me how to trade BTC/USD or XRP/USD on said demo accounts. 

I would also like to mention that I have no desire to trade actual bitcoin but more like the cash value of bitcoin. 

Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/k0jwcu/help_a_newbie_out/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/k0jwcu/help_a_newbie_out/,6,15,2020-11-25 03:06:44,TryingToMoney,"Honestly if you are ONLY interested in cryptos, check out crypto exchanges like coinbase or bitstamp. 

And also, you can't trade the ""cash value"" of cryptos sorry. Bitcoin futures aren't a thing so you have to trade the asset itself. Crypto exchanges make it easy and intuitive however.

It sounds like you want to trade crypto in the form of forex. I would suggest a forex.com account, and the MT4 platform. This allows BTC and XRP against USD. It does not allow for anything else, other than ethereum though, so if you want a full list of cryptos you are better off going the route of a crypto exchange.

It’s better to trade the cash value of bitcoin, and on a bitcoin exchange like Coinbase. You can earn rewards and it’s a delight to transfer money. Keep the traditional brokers (forex.com, CMC Markets, fxview) for forex trading. And if you want to really excel, concentrate only on 1 pair.

I'm sorry but bitcoin futures are DEFINITELY a thing

Thank you for the broker suggestion! I actually made a forex demo account about a month ago and it was one of the demos that I couldn’t figure out how to trade BTC against USD. Maybe this was because it was *just* a demo account? 

If I do take the route of a crypto exchange, would you happen to know if I am still able to trade the cash value or do I have to actually purchase and trade crypto itself?

Thanks again! :)

I'm looking at Oanda right now, and it seems the spread is 0.5. That being said, I'm not sure if that's the cheapest way to trade some derivative of the S&P500. For example, if you equate the value to /ES (S&P500 futures), you'll find that in comparison, you're paying the equivalent of 2 ticks (since the spread of /ES is pretty much .25 all the time). 

Is it cheaper than Bitmex? Sure, but I think that's comparing apples to oranges. Is it cheaper to trade the S&P500 on Oanda? I don't think so given the above information : D, hope this helps"

I've had this happen to me on crypto derivatives. It happens if you don't have enough available margin to open a position in another direction. Stop loss has to be reduce-only type, or else if you don't have enough margin to open such position, stop loss will be cancled.

I didnt try to reverse the position, just trying to close it you dont need margin to close a position.

Trading cfd and forex with oanda and interactive brokers was the most frustrating time in my trading carreer.

Now for the most part Forex trading is dead in the US. All the good ECN brokers are overseas and they all ban US traders because the US government makes it impossible for them to accept people from the US

So in the Land Of The Free we have two major forex brokers Oanda AKA regulated Market Maker and Forex.com. Google Forexpeacearmy and the name of each of those brokers for reviews.

What’s the significance of the pig?

Theses fucking analyst are a joke

You hear that, institutions?  Bitcoin knows you want some.  Bitcoin wants you to make the first move.   Don't be afraid, Bitcoin will treat you right.

tldr; Bitcoin's intraday rally follows a near 36% rise over the past month as traders look to institutional demand to fuel further upside. A break above $60,000 is not a matter of if, but when, said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, a foreign exchange broker. The market is ""in wait-and-see mode, in what seems to be a healthy consolidation,"" said Moya.

CryptoCurrency,oanda,(Proof) We have proof that institutions typically do NOT buy crypto during weekends/holidays!,"I have been suspecting for quite a while that institutions typically do **NOT** buy crypto during weekends/holidays.

Usually my comments get downvoted, and people say something like ""surely by now institutions have learnt to buy during weekends"", ""surely they have an intern working on weekends to press the buy button"".

Now we have proof!

>“**This could be an interesting weekend for bitcoin as much of the institutional money is expected to be dormant**,” said **Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda**. “**Weekend volatility has been somewhat of a story this year**, so many crypto watchers will look to see if any whales try to take advantage of illiquid conditions.”

Basically, for large institutions, buying crypto is likely not as easy as going to an exchange and pressing the ""buy"" button. Due to the large amount of money involved, there is likely to be multiple legal paperwork that needs to be filed, the big boss needs to approve, etc, all this is best done on a workday, i.e. Monday to Friday.

Even Elon Musk likely needs approval from the board of directors to buy crypto using Tesla's funds. Sure, if he buys using his own money he doesn't need approval, but if he is using company money he does.

# How this information is useful?

This info could be useful because it means that weekend dips are likely due to retail investors selling. It may not mean that institutional money is dumping. Hence, weekend dips are a good opportunity to buy the dip.

Although volume might be less lower than weekends most crypto trades are executed by bots. Spikes are often triggered by human FOMO or panic.

I’d imagine companies use bots to buy, honestly. i.e., it buys BTC every several seconds, and more so when the price dips 2%, 3%, etc. This would keep their average buy-in lower, and allow for flexibility on the balance sheet.

You think Goldman sachs is buying banano soon?

It is unlikely that Elon needs to go to the Tesla board for approval of every crypto purchase.  What they would do is authorize purchase of $XX billion (I'm dreaming) and leave it up to the corporate executive (Elon) to determine how and when to make the purchases.  *...so it's easily possible that even entities with oversight requirements are buying on weekends, if that is to their advantage.*"
CryptoCurrency,oanda,BBC News takes consistently bearish position on cryptocurrencies?,"I post this because I live in the UK and the BBC is without doubt the premier news website. Indeed some data suggests that it has [more traffic than any other news site in the world](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/2020/worlds-most-visited-news-site)

The BBC also has a special position in UK law as it is bound by a Royal charter which requires it to remain independent and have politically unbiased coverage of the news as a part of its mission to inform, educate, and entertain. It also has unique funding as UK resident TV licence fees contribute to their income.

It always catches my eye when the BBC News website publishes an article about cryptocurrencies. 15 hours ago they published this article.

[Dogecoin takes off after tip by Elon Musk](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55939854)

Which goes into a lot of detail about the pitfalls of cryptoassets without covering the benefits:

‘However, with no intrinsic value like gold or land, and no ability to generate an income like a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise.

This makes them hard to value and makes their prices susceptible to tips from backers or sudden panics.

Critics point out that while any given cryptocurrency may have a finite supply of units, the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless.

People have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and corrupted or lost hard drives.

Bitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000.

Because the cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated like cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard.

Last month, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets.

The financial watchdog said investors should be ""prepared to lose all their money"" should their investment's value collapse.’

Their previous article on the topic had a similarly doom-mongering headline:

[Cryptoasset investing? Be prepared to lose the lot, warns watchdog](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55615514)

Although the text of the article was more cautionary, warning people of get-rich quick schemes and also potential fraudulent scam activity and I agree this is one aspect of the coverage which is definitely in the public’s interest.

A previous post about [bitcoin reaching its three-year high in November 2020](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54982604) did mention its scarcity as an upside for investment but again mostly focused on the risks and downsides associated with cryptocurrencies:

‘But Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility.

""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes.""

Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO).

""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver.

""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" ‘

Of course, I understand that they are reporting this in an independent way and they have a duty not to take a position on long term market value, I feel that the positives of decentralisation, transactional transparency, and technological problem-solving which many cryptocurrencies offer are not covered in as much detail as the risks and downsides.

This has the potential end result of delaying mainstream adoption and making the public distrust the cryptocurrency market outright rather than taking a considered and balanced approach.

How do you think these issues can be tackled? I am a general supporter of the BBC’s news coverage but Surely one of the most widely read and trusted news sources in the world shouldn’t institutionally be a harbinger of so much negativity?

Else the general public don’t get a more complete informed view of this ever-developing field...


TL:DR - The BBC usually has fair and balanced reporting to properly inform the public. They seem to be consistently reinforcing the negatives with cryptocurrencies with limited reporting of the positives. I believe this is presenting an incomplete view to the public and is risking the public being less well informed. How can this be tackled?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ld2nel/bbc_news_takes_consistently_bearish_position_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ld2nel/bbc_news_takes_consistently_bearish_position_on/,36,85,2021-02-05 08:10:32,pippius,"I have a consistently bearish position on the future of bbc

""However, with no intrinsic value like gold or land,""

This is a classic myth and has been answered in multiple FAQ's and papers and here many times.

I feel sorrow for the BBC, for a lot of my life they were a beacon of rationality against a wild and sensationalist British media. 

However over the last 10 years, the Conservatives and right wing media have beaten the impartiality right out of them. 

Cameron and Osborne used to regularly threaten them in public about pulling the license fee if they didn't tow the line, the board has since been stacked with Tory donors, and the new head of is, you guessed it, a massive Tory donor. 

Meanwhile every right leaning media outlet accuses them of extreme left bias, no matter how clear it is that facts show the opposite, and despite grit and determination, they're succumbing to it, moving further and further toward pro Government, pro Conservative opinions. 

They are now, from a news angle anyway, simply an authoritarian state media mouth piece. On other aspects they still produce some great content, but it won't last. Comedy will go, nature documentaries will go, radio is already being slimmed down, cut up, and original content removed in favour of repetition. 

And as always with right wing neoliberal Governments, it's the same path, undermine, de-fund, break apart, privatise.

It is really sad, they were such a fantastic institution Brits could be quietly proud of, but it has been ruined like so so many other things, by pure ideological fantasy. 

Edit: spelling, grammar, sentence structure

I think there's alo an underlying issue with the UK's finalcial regulators (I work im digital banking) as they can be quite hectic in regards to investment news.

Also BBC IS biased, even with the charter, and with their private funding coming kostky from international governments I'd be surprised if they took a pro-crypto sramce at this stage.

Utter lack of understanding the fundamentals. It’s not just a trade-able asset, these blockchain networks have purpose, the value they provide is what you should be assessing, this value generates positive or negative sentiment which affects the demand and with finite supply it affects the price directly. It’s common sense investing but the bbc can’t see that?"

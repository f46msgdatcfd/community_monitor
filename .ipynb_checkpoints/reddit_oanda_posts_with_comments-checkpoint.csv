Forex,Forex trading in Japan,"Hello everybody!

I want to start trading and I am currently gathering a lot of information and try to learn about the market. Dont worry, I will start with trading as soon as I have the feeling I know enough. For me it is not a quick money tactic but more a curiosity about the market and what we can do with it.

I am currently an international student in Japan and I will most likely live here for the next 2 years. So if there is someone like me living in Japan and trading, what brokers do you recommend me for beginners? I looked into OANDA Japan but it seems like it is only available in Japanese (duh) so I am not sure if there is more option.


It is my first post here so I hope someone can help me out!

Start with paper trading, TradingView.

Your location doesn't matter. Your tax residency does.

good point actually...I heard about tradingview where you can get used to the charts and the market movement. Is there a demo version implemented too?

Yeah, TradingView has built-in paper trading. It‚Äôs not super advanced and has its quirks, like you can‚Äôt really track performance in depth, but it‚Äôs great for getting started. It lets you get comfortable with the tools, charts, and different markets.

Later on, when tracking your performance becomes more important, you can always open a demo account with a broker and switch to a different platform that‚Äôs better suited for that.

Forex,My Personal Best,"Sorry if the text of this post doesn't really make sense but I just wanted to post because This moment has been a long time coming. I have 'finally' (i know some people don't ever see this amount of money in the markets) made 1k in a single trade and a single day (24 hours because technically i opened the trade last night). after losing several thousands of dollars over more than half a decade between shitty courses, funded account challenges, and personal trading account loses, I can finally say I have achieved 'The Big One'. To some of you this may seem like peanuts, to others it may be a life changing amount of money, but to me it is proof. Everyone in my life that I have told about my trading has doubted me and said I was making a mistake. While this may be just another trade to some this is about finally overcoming a milestone for me. 

  
With this trade I have been able to prove to myself that trading is a viable option for my future. I know that some of you will say that I am making a mistake by going down this route and that's ok. I am not a full time trader, Calling myself a part time trader might even be a little bit of an overstatement. I have a full time job and a Girlfriend so obviously I am not able to commit as much time as others to this endeavor but this is still a milestone mark for me. this trade is what proved to MYSELF that I am able to do this full time in the future. 

  
If you are able to read a tradingview chart you understand what happened but if not let me explain. I entered a trade for a GBPUSD buy on Monday night (EST) and it ended up in profit but I had moved my SL into profit and I got stopped out a little over 30 pips in profit, but I knew that there was more upward movement coming so I reentered the trade. Maintaining the confidence I had in my original position is what led to this big trade (currently \~250 pips in profit). Sorry for the long winded message, this is more for me than anything but if you have any thoughts, comments, or concerns please don't hesitate to let me know.",https://i.redd.it/3l7smtuow3ue1.png,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jwehdf/my_personal_best/,7,3,2025-04-11 01:38:59,peopleeater23,"Congratulations on this achievment! 

BUT, as i'm sure you know... a single trade does not matter... Sure, you made money.. but if you're losing it over the next few trades, it means nothing.

Please update us at the end of the year i really hope you're consistent at execution and at managing risk.

Forex,Progress towards Prop Firm Challenge,"So I've been trading awhile on my algo on Oanda live with my own money, which has been successful, but my boss (who also trades forex) suggested I do a prop firm challenge since if I can get funded, then I'll be able to make a higher return faster. I trade strictly by algo, but he trades manually, but I was able to create an indicator for him that helped with his strategy that got him funded this past week.

Me, I blew up 3 free demo accounts with the prop firm last week, just figuring out their broker's api plus the tariff nonsense. I'm happy to say that this week I've managed to stay profitable every single day without even going close to the DD limit after I made some adaptations to my risk management logic.

Anyway, I attached a pic of my equity curve you can see on the 100k demo account. If you have any questions, I'll do my best to answer.

Some changes I made:

\* Dropped my nominal volume to $400.00 per position

\* Set my TP on entry based on the entry price (see if i can get a quick nab), wait 30s, then set TP based on DCA price

\* Block USDZAR, USDTHB from trading

\* Trust my algo, never prune winners or losers early

  
\*\*Disclaimer\*\*:

Not trying to sell an algo or advertise or anything, mostly just wanted to share my progress towards my goal of a funded account and to encourage people to not give up. Takes a lot of retooling to stay within prop firm rules while also staying realistically profitable! I feel proud with the progress I've had and I'll update you guys once I buy a challenge.",https://i.redd.it/w4xqtb81ayte1.png,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jvrcng/progress_towards_prop_firm_challenge/,5,19,2025-04-10 06:29:32,Fold-Plastic,"It appears this thread is about Prop Firms and Scouting Programs.

I find this incredibly neat upward trend highly unbelievable.

can't edit the op for some reason, but rereading the sub rules I'll give a little more detail.

should be obvious but this is a scalping algo trading 15 usd pairs on the 10 min. $400 nominal volume per entry, TP 0.02%. normally fills a smidge over the tp price and $3-4 per win after fees.

I don't have numbers on trades per day but it's something like 50-100.

How is the risk managed?

First of all congratulations bro u are in top 5 percent and second of all tell me the setupüò≠

What's unbelievable? I pulled it right from the prop firm dashboard? It reflects realized balance.

edit: here's the current chart [https://ibb.co/MDWgtw3w](https://ibb.co/MDWgtw3w)

Both by the specific take profit target and the opportunity entries are given to cash out immediately rather than DCA only.

that's very kind of you. there's still more work I need to do to take only the best entry prices and tighten up my drawdown (not reflected in chart, chart is just **realized** pnl, I hold until I win so it looks great). as for this particular strat, it's literally just a simple indicator from tradingview that I slapped on alerts when it hits key zones. imo, my secret sauce is the risk management more than the strat.

Unbelievable in that a chart like that with a linear result looks made up. If it‚Äôs not, then it‚Äôs just unbelievably good. What do the rest of the dashboard results look like.

Forex,I caught this masterpiece entry on Gold. 1.5% return.,"Reasoning: Gold has been extremely bullish these past few months. Every time it settles on a new All Time High it has a slight pattern of retracing into a weekly FVG b4 reversing back upward and making a new All Time High. Price was overall bullish on the weekly but was retracing and with a simple look at the chart I already had a damn good idea where price wanted to go which was the most recent weekly FVG and also the only FVG within that bullish extension, so I wanted to enter in there. I watched as price slowly targetted the weekly FVG and the asian session eventually tapped into it, but I still waited. Off the power of 3 rule I naturally assumed that another session(presumably the new york session) would sweep back the old asian session low and give me deeper contact in the weekly FVG. I waited to the next day and the New York session gave me exactly just that. I entered off a 15 minute break of structure and targetted previous session highs. I set my stop below the weekly FVG and my Take profit at a past London high. I risked 1.5% to gain 1.5% roughly. I then waited around a day and half for my Take profit to get hit. I basically betted that I was catching Gold in its rebalancing/pullback act. All on demo btw to be clear. Just experimenting.",https://i.redd.it/3x4w6usjxste1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jv4hv9/i_caught_this_masterpiece_entry_on_gold_15_return/,16,1,2025-04-09 12:25:11,Hour_Ant323,Genuinly could have held this position from anywhere to a few weeks to a few months as long as Gold kept rising.
Forex,OB Strategy can't be a main one?,"Hi guys, I am still relatively new to trading I guess, so please forgive me for any mistakes here and there. 

Starting off with the topic then:   
My main strategy for entering any position is through Order Block zones, I draw them only when I consider them valid i.e. BOS, Inefficiency/FVG, (I still need to incorporate Breaker Blocks, but for now normal OB are fine).  


Entries are variable but for the sake of this post let's say as soon as price hits OB, enter trade, with SL a few pips above OB, TP is 3R/4R depending on the market. 

I do not expect this to be a bullet proof strategy but there are times where market will not respect these key zones over and over again, making it an absolute bloodbath. 

  
What other confluence should I consider? or should I just ditch this completely?

  
Image: 

90% of the OB are on the 5 minutes time frame with 1/2 on the 15 minute. 

the **RED** indicate failed OB.

the **GREEN** indicate respected OB.

the **GREY** indicate price did not tap in the zone. 

the **Purple**, ignore it.

A very colourful one, but nonetheless. If you get half those words out of your vocabulary you will do better. The idea of understanding where people have set their stops/orders is not bad, this FVG and all those other made up terms are meaningless. individual candles have no meaning, since their appearance would completely change if they were offset by 50%, while the price movement would be exactly the same.

A strategy can only ""work"" once you apply money management rules. Otherwise you're just doing a bunch of nothing. Gambling perhaps.

So your saying price action is bullshit?

Single candle stuff, yes

Ahaa so how do you trade?

Just look at the chart. Not that tiny stuff represented by a single candle, the FVG etc. that‚Äôs just down to the randomness of where a candle happened to open and close during the continuous movement of the price.

That's real, but i mean like what do u look at, what's your POI?

Everyone has their own. For me it‚Äôs about breakouts. Which is why current environment is so good. And it‚Äôs more important what you do after entering than before."

Forex,OANDA vs IBKR,Why is OANDA more popular then IBKR when it comes to forex trading?

Yea I‚Äôd say that‚Äôs a huge selling point if you‚Äôre on really short duration trades. If you‚Äôre a swinger than a few pips aren‚Äôt gunna kill the move.

both suck for leverage-CFD, unless you are from the USA

Don't tell the OP what to do ü§£

Buddy, you have no data to suggest it will go higher than 3085. You can only be confident with zone setups like these that price will return to a level it has reached before. You setting some arbitrary R:R level assumes you know how the market will play out, which you can‚Äôt. Your SL is way too tight, too. What if it closes above your zone for a few candles then briefly dips below SL? Trading gold that would be a big L. If I were you, unless I have real data showing me otherwise, I‚Äôd set TP to 3085 and get rid of your SL (if you‚Äôre even using one)

Most of the time brokers take an Admin fee instead of swaps (interest) on Islamic accounts. But that admin fee tends to be very similar in price price to swaps (from what I‚Äôve seen) üòÇ

I just manually go through news, tweets, rumours, CTFC commitment of traders reports, commodity prices, stock prices, equities etc. Takes me about 2-3 hours to establish my weekly bias, I usually do this at the beginning of every trading week, then I'll also do short 30min-1hour sessions on my trading days.

Forex,Confused about Prop Firm profitability,"Hey guys, been researching Forex for a few months. Primarily understanding price action, general market analysis, and have been using TradingView's basic plan to perform basic backtesting. I also have a background in mathematics so I'm not confused by ideas that arise from risk management and long term profitability.


I have been planning out how to foray into starting trading, but prop firms seem to be utterly impossible to make work? I've only deep dived on Oanda, so I will be referencing their structure.


Let me run through an example. A trader buys a challenge, where they are provided a virtual account with $100,000 for $599. 10% max dynamic drawdown and 5% dynamic daily drawdown. Phase 1 needs 8% profit. Phase 2 needs 5% profit. Total of 13% profit. 


To adhere with risk management, their real account size is effectively $10,000 (drawdown). To ensure natural variance doesn't kick their ass, 1% risked for each trade is a solid idea, therefore, $100 risked. By itself, that's awesome. If the trader could take immediate profits that is an easy $599 -> $10,000. From here on, I reference the eventual funded account as being $10,000, as that is the $$ available to the trader.


Now how can a trader actually become funded? 


If we take an example edge, let's say 1:2 risk:return, with a 40% winrate, the traders expected value is (0.40x0.02-0.60x0.01) = 0.002. i.e. over a large sample size they will make a return of 0.2% of their max drawdown each trade. That's $20EV for a goal of $13,000 before being able to take profit. It should be noted that a 40% accuracy is pretty god damn high when the true breakeven is 33.3%



This is utterly ludicrous haha. Sure, I think once you become funded and can make a withdrawal of minimum $200, that's a reasonable way to start (for $599 too!). But it would take a risk-conscious trader $13,000/$20 = 650 trades to become funded.


I have other ideas, such as implementing a higher risk:reward for the short-term. I wrote a python script which simulated the results of and it seemed possible that you could up the risk:reward to something like 10% of max drawdown to 20% of max drawdown, but I didn't have time to get very far into my analysis. Off the top of my head you could get 30% - 60% of your attempts funded with various scales of accuracy and risk:reward of max drawdown.


Further than that, let's say you do your best and keep trying. Even if a riskier strategy provides a 50% chance to fund an account, it's not unreasonable for you to fail 3+ times at those odds. Every fail is $599. $599 of your eventual $10,000 account is 5.9%. That's approximately two to six months of trading (given a reasonable expectation of around 1% - 5% return per month).


Can someone provide insights into what I am currently considering? 


Feel free to disagree with my math as well, I'd love feedback on it.

Edit: changed EV calc as it italicized from the *",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j57fyd/confused_about_prop_firm_profitability/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j57fyd/confused_about_prop_firm_profitability/,0,5,2025-03-06 22:02:19,FruitFliesLikeBonana,"It appears this thread is about Prop Firms and Scouting Programs. [**A detailed overview and comparison of popular forex prop firms can be found here.**](https://volatility.red/Trader_Scouting_and_Prop_Firms_Overview_and_Comparison)      


*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Forex) if you have any questions or concerns.*

The equation I use to determine prop firm risk per trade is max drawdown / my max losing streak across x data‚Ä¶ and then I reduce it a bit. In this case if a trader doesn‚Äôt often see a 10R drawdown in their trading then it is worth them risking 1% on a prop account. The ROI can be huge!

Of course if you often lose 20R (would be crazy imo) then you can risk 0.5% and still get a very good ROI.

It‚Äôs not a personal account and it doesn‚Äôt cost the same as a personal account which has the same buying power in the market would, so there‚Äôs no reason to risk only 1% of the max drawdown.

A simple look at your trading strategy data over a year would tell you all you need to know in order to optimise your prop firm risk management for max ROI.

You need $62.5 a day with 100K account to get funded in 1 year. That‚Äôs 2 x Nas100 scalps a day with like 2.5 lots targetting 15 points or one trade with 5 lots. That can be made at NY open with a little bit of daily prayers easily.

Forex,How many of you are algo traders?,"I've been algo trading stocks and crypto for a few years, and while I've traded forex before, it's only been the last few months I've really focused on forex specifically because of the leverage and because my boss is really into it though he hand trades, doesn't use algos.

I have to admit this has been working gangbusters for me though! trading 16 pairs fully auto and just making little tweaks here and there to inch up my daily return. I honestly feel like this market is way better than stocks and crypto.

My technical set up is tv webhooks to a python server to Oanda, and I livechart all my results in Google sheets also automatically which is fun to watch while I work at my desk.

I'm curious how many of you are also deploying algos? and what's your technical set up look like?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j18vco/how_many_of_you_are_algo_traders/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1j18vco/how_many_of_you_are_algo_traders/,6,12,2025-03-01 20:25:22,tat_tvam_asshole,"Look into r/algotrading . I do both live trading and algo trading at low volumes whilst I test my strategy and finesse the code. I too have a TV pinescript API call setup into fxcm, but plan to upgrade this to a more sophisticated ML python solution through Visual studio code and API connections with brokers. I've been working on my master strategy for a couple years now and am pretty happy with it, barring some tweaks needed to risk management side. And also in midst of changing brokers as I've qualified for a pro level account with 1000:1 leverage and super tight spreads with IC Markets.

U can also use the Python bridge in mt5. I did work on pattern recognition (it would look at certain formation of swing low/high patterns and other indicators) hooked up to  mongodb and it was mildly successful. The biggest drawback of algo trading is making it understand the' change in regime'. The work that we did encompassed creating entirely different modules in signal generation, risk management, order management, portfolio risk management etc. Risk was a big part of it. Project is on hold for now, we are looking to take up on it once this learning model expert comes on board.

Ps oanda didn't provide any tick data, they have a limit on how many API calls u can make on their restful API.

Have you tried writing the code only by ChatGPT? I found for my strategy it somehow cannot debug its own code (python).

I completely understand you, I was into coding algos for futures but that was a mess of its own. 

Like someone else here said, creating algos ironically has became my trading income alongside trading itself. 
I‚Äôve tried to deploy with python but I now heavily rely on mql4 and mql5 strictly. I‚Äôve learned to transfer code between the two.

Currently running 3 pairs,

‚Ä¢Gold
‚Ä¢GbpJpy
‚Ä¢Eurusd

Averaging about 0.28% daily.

Regime change isn't difficult to detect/code, ime. I just use Oanda as a broker, not for data, and I trade 30min candles so API limit isn't a huge deal breaker anyway.

Are you looking into ML for parameter optimization, price prediction, or entry/exit prediction? I have a bit of experience in this area.

Oanda does actually provide tick data via their web socket connection, or FIX API.

That's highly dependent on the system of packages you choose (whether or not you can create/recreate a strategy). I'm almost certain though that whatever errors you're encountering are debugable by an AI. It may more likely be an issue of how you're prompting it. The heaviest stuff we do for data manipulation and TA is fairly entry level python stuff handled by pandas, numpy, and ta-lib.

Shoot me a DM.
I can take a look at it. ChatG really isn‚Äôt the best in coding, even o3-mini high isnt that good.

Oanda tick prices is stp prices, spreads are too high and FIX is reserved for high networth client and i would never open a brokerage account in oanda. However I like their mobile app. Dukas copy is another option but fix is reserved for high networth client.

They gave me access with acees with a $5000 account. I also find oanda's finance rates to be acceptable for long term trades to make up for the, tbh not drastic spread. 

I also don't know what you mean by stp"

Forex,Advice on currency pairs for SMC,"Hi everyone, I'm new to FX trading and using a paper money account to develop some strategies. I'm studying these so called ""Smart Money Concepts"" of looking at market structure, liquidity, and order blocks to try to follow institutional moves (largely based on concepts from YouTubers Photon Trading / Matt Donlevey and Fortune Talks). I began by watching Jason Graystone's content but was constantly getting stopped out, so I found these liquidity concepts interesting.

  
Anyway, I'm having a hard time identifying which currency pairs to trade. USD-based pairs have the highest volume, but they're all obviously tied to the performance of USD. So, I believe there's a huge correlation risk if just trading the USD pairs. Some of the pairs (NZD/CHF) are extremely low volume and have quite choppy price action. I mostly use 1D as my higher timeframe and 1H as my trading timeframe, sometimes looking at 15min for confirmation. 5min has burned me too many times so far.

  
What advice do you all have about selecting which currency pairs to monitor and trade? All of the major currency pairs is too overwhelming for me. I have a hard time assessing the true trading volume; Google indicates EUR/USD is the highest volume pair, but I rarely see it having the highest volume displayed in TradingView (Oanda is my broker).",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1itsokb/advice_on_currency_pairs_for_smc/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1itsokb/advice_on_currency_pairs_for_smc/,3,3,2025-02-20 07:08:43,Expwy,"Forex is a decentralized market, there‚Äôs no way to know the true volume information like you can with stocks or futures. I wouldn‚Äôt rely on any strategy that involves volume for Forex due to this.

Also, you do you, but personally I recommend staying away from SMC stuff. It‚Äôs overly-complicated and for no added benefit, is also based on a lot of overly-simplistic incorrect assumptions about how markets work, and is often created and peddled by scammers and fraudsters. 

Price action & market structure are IMO the best place to start as a trader. Tradeciety is a good resource for that type of stuff, but there are plenty of other sources out there.

If you‚Äôre day trading then just pick a few pairs that aren‚Äôt too correlated. Perhaps EURUSD and GBPJPY, or something like that. You can honestly even get away with only one pair as a day trader. 

If you‚Äôre swing trading, then you‚Äôll probably want at least 3 pairs, if not more, to monitor since setups will be less frequent.

Thanks a lot for taking the time to reply. It's interesting what you say about SMC. I started to explore it as a response to my stops getting blown out and then price going in the direction I was essentially trading anyway. Do you have experience with that, or advice on avoiding that scenario? Do you look at areas where there might be a lot of liquidity built up and place your stop losses beyond those, or do you ignore liquidity concepts entirely? I could just set wider stop losses too of course. I realize that at the end of the day it's all about establishing a firm set of rules that work for me.

  
And noted regarding the pairs, thanks for that. I've actually had good results with GBP/JPY over time. Right now I mostly swing trade as I still have a day job, although my goal is to eventually support myself by trading.

You‚Äôre welcome. Yeah it‚Äôs a common thing traders do in the beginning, feels like every trade singles you out personally just to take your stop and then take off. But that‚Äôs not what‚Äôs actually happening. 

I don‚Äôt use liquidity concepts, no. I made a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/s/uhl86p09bH) awhile back regarding some things that can happen to inexperienced traders that can make it *feel* like the market is out to get them (when it‚Äôs not), and some possible basic solutions.

First of all, most people choose brokers for a good trading environment & spreads, such as IG, ICmarket, Vantage

What do you mean by ‚Äúgetting sniped so hard‚Äù?

See my post

You can even use the 1h time frame, just make sure you have a good SL.

Usually at the end of North America session the spread widen I think it's due to less liquidity. The spread usually doesn't get larger than 15 pips. When the Asian session opens a couple hours later the spread tightens back to normal.

Also I have only been trading for a few weeks so I can only tell you what I know based on what I've experienced with my broker. So I'm curious if it's the same with other brokers

You don't trade based on what you think. You trade based on what you see, and what you see is how the market plays out.   
  
It could be -   
  
1) uptrend because global yield is rising and JPY depreciates  
2) JPY appreciates because we are on a risk off environment. 

3) GBP depreciates because of growth concerns in the UK economy.

It is rejecting from a daily time frame doji supply, Also a good trend continuation quasimodo level, trend is bearish and market structure is bearish as price broke the last lower low and created another lower low on 4h Time frame.. when you take volume profile of the bearish leg then it aligns perfectly with the supply.. this is very high probable setup brother.

Well, since you just sold it for no apparent reason, sounds like you might be gambling‚Ä¶

AUDJPY‚Äôs been on a steady sell-off for a while now, take a look at the daily chart and see where the price is COMING FROM and how it reacted to that level. Then, check sentiment and fundamentals. What‚Äôs the long-term outlook? What‚Äôs the short-term play?

Looking at how price is reacting on the H4 and Daily, do you really think that tiny level on the hourly is going to hold up when you‚Äôre selling with no confirmation, no momentum slowing down, and no solid reasons to back it up? Probably not‚Ä¶

Sometimes is best to have a fix risk is best

Take partials next time bro

Against the trend should always be watching close to your target

Having a perfect RR ratio will always do more harm than good. Anyone saying otherwise is just lying and trying to sell you something. If you're trading swings then never, never, never have your TP be past a SR level. There are what I call weak and strong SR levels... nobody teaches this stuff though (because they don't stop to think) and I never really shared it online. But the fact remains...

It amazes me how many people that ""teach"" on YT don't stop to think about this. YouTubers just parrot info for clicks I swear. Anyway, you are literally trading swings here.... think about it.

Now technically, price rejected at a weak SR level since it was invalidated. So, if I were taking that trade then I would've had a partial close at the weak level and then move up my SL to break even. In this instance, you would've gotten 50% of your original goal that way.

Most people never teach this, but just because an SR level is invalidated and becomes ""weak"" (what I call it) doesn't mean it won't be retested. Don't take my word for it, go study previous PA and see for yourself.

So, the key takeaway here is better risk management and loss mitigation strategies.

1. If you're not watching the charts 24/7 and swing trading (not scalping) then consider a trailing stop or partial close. Use the partial close around ""weak"" SR levels that have been invalidated.
2. If using a partial close, move your SL to break even once it triggers.

You're welcome.

In the press release they have mentioned that they‚Äôll keep OANDA as a standalone entity

Just wanted to add that, I received an email today from ftmo about a confidential survey regarding the U.S trading landscape. I feel like maybe we could be starting to see the light again! Hopefully they will open back up to US clientele

They could still use their Oanda's US registration to open a prop business in the USA.

For me, this deal takes FTMO reputation to a totally different level vs other prop firms! They are currently in a class of their own!!

I see, thanks.

Forex,Problems with insufficient margin,"I mostly trade GBP/USD on TradingView and I use Oanda as my broker, but often times when I try to risk 2-3% of my account, it doesn‚Äôt let me. I have a small account of around $500, and my trades only get approved if I risk around 1% of my account. Can someone explain to me what I‚Äôm missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1ifpfhf/problems_with_insufficient_margin/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1ifpfhf/problems_with_insufficient_margin/,4,5,2025-02-02 04:41:48,Astreum98,"Margin requirements come from two things:

(1) the leverage of the pair

(2) the size of your trade (in units/lots)

For (1), GBPUSD‚Äôs leverage is 20:1, one of the lowest leverages offered, meaning the margin requirements are higher for this pair.

For (2), the lower the timeframe you trade on, the less pips you‚Äôre typically risking. This means you need *more* size to get the same risk, which increases the margin requirements further.

So, there are a number of things you can do. You can either:

-be okay with risking less than you want

-add more money to your account to cover the margin required

-trade a different pair with a higher leverage, for example a 50:1 pair like EURUSD or USDCAD

-move up a timeframe or two (like if you‚Äôre trading on the 1min, try the 5min, etc) and/or widen your SL to risk more pips and thus reduce your trade size, lowering the margin required

1. there's nothing wrong with a small account balance. You just need to understand that returns, while using sustainable risk practices... won't be significant.
2. You need to learn how leverage works in the markets.

Your forex broker offers a leverage of (likely) 1:50 or 1:100...

Now when does that come in to play? when you're trading small stop loss values... 3..4..5 pips. Why? because to risk 1..2 or idk 3 % of your capital over 5 pips, that requires an unusually large LOT size for your account size...

while if you're risking the same % of capital but over 30pips, that size is MUCH smaller.

So if you're really going for opening ""large positions"" with tight stops, just go for a higher leverage account.. 1:500 or something close to that spectre will do.

Do i think you should? Deffinitely not.

probably you dont have enough leverage.

You can trade a little more with eurusd but those rules are good for you. Don‚Äôt really want to be risking so much

I'm not seeing any direction out there on the daily charts, looks like I will wait after the Fridays data.

I'm more of a discretionary trader the idea behind these trades is avoiding this week altogether feels mixed all week but it's hard for me to find confidence bc I can't test anything my idea is to be a fundamental discretionary trader and I want to use daily chart only and fixed stop of 160 pips and large targets 700 800 1200 pips I'm planning to start live trading this year so I need all the feedback I can get.

I'm not sure I have anything to back test being discretionary. I want to flow with the market with my entries and using stop loss¬†fixed at 160 and large tp.

Listen I and some other people might not agree with this especially since your trading against the trend but if you backtested your strategy and it works then you don‚Äôt need to listen to anyone

Never seen so much amateurism pretending to be knowledgeable in single chart and I‚Äôm not even talking about the counter trend bias.

Where is the fair value gap you're talking about?

The demand for gold has increased because people and governments can no longer rely on the USD as a safe haven (the US government has weaponised it with endless sanctions and debasing by printing too much of it). 

The value of gold is now back and with it being finite, its value will only go up over time!

Your technicals for a short of that magnitude is irrelevant. A multi month/year swing is driven by fundamentals not technicals!

I mean, if you think the price (and gold specifically) moves because all that stuff you draw there..."

Forex,Getting off the 1 minute chart,"Seeking advice!

I‚Äôve been trading the 1 minute EUR/JPY chart for around 6 months with a $200 Oanda account, never allowing more than a $2 loss.

Unfortunately, as a substitute teacher in California, I‚Äôm restricted to scalping during the Tokyo session.

I‚Äôd like to begin transitioning into higher time frames, but don‚Äôt feel I know how. 

I‚Äôd rather make 1 or two trades a day, check in on them once or twice, and not be trapped in the scalping headspace.

How should I begin working up?",https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1hxhpva/getting_off_the_1_minute_chart/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1hxhpva/getting_off_the_1_minute_chart/,0,21,2025-01-09 17:12:33,Pipesandboners,"Might be quite the change, and obviously you can stick to day trading if it works better for you but you could also consider swing trading. 

I used to day trade the 5min chart, but a little over a year ago I transitioned to swing trading. I do my analysis on the daily and execute on the 4hr. Took some getting used to for sure, and I changed my strategy (not always required) to one better suited to passive trading. 

Now I do all my analysis and set alerts near my setups from my PC on the weekend. Once price hits an alert throughout the week, I‚Äôll check it on my phone (from wherever I am). 

If I like it, I‚Äôll set a pending order (limit or stop order depending on the situation) and so then if price truly reaches my setup, it‚Äôll get me in automatically without me being on the chart. Then I‚Äôll set alerts to let me know when the trade reaches certain points so I don‚Äôt have to keep checking it.

This makes it so that I only spend up to 2-3 hours total per *week* on trading related stuff, including weekend analysis and journaling (which takes the most time). And my schedule is very flexible. Before, I spent 2-3 hours per *day* on trading, and had to be actively on the chart at the same time everyday.

I was a similar way, I work 9-5 so it made trading really difficult without being by my phone/laptop all day to monitor. 

I would still trade in the Asian if that‚Äôs working for you, but look for setups on the 4h or 1h with the strategy you‚Äôre currently using and see how it works on a demo. Might need some tweaking for the higher time frame, just backtest and see what happens. 

That‚Äôs the same reason I learned to code and just wrote my strategies as an algo, so I don‚Äôt ever have to touch my laptop (which is nice ü§£). 

Good luck!

1. Making 1 or 2 traders per day is not going to align with your ""check once or twice"" idea... Just to enter that, you'll need to invest A LOT of screen time.  A setup is there, when it gets there.. Not when you want it to get there.

2. Living in california can be pretty expensive, no? So let's say one can consistently make 10-20 % gain per annum (realistic goals)....  you'd need what? 500k in capital at least, just to live a decent life, rigt? Just something to think about for the future

Google no nonsense forex. That strategy is exactly what you are describing. He has a you tube channel that goes over the strategy in extreme detail.

Aside from looking for new strategies/setups, one thing you might have difficulty in is how much you can risk. At higher timeframes, the possible drawdown is much higher than at lower timeframes. You will probably need to decrease your lot size significantly. On the flip side, you're also aiming for increased pip gains. Just to give an idea, it's like halving your lot size, but doubling your TP, works out to be about the same, but usually with swing trades you aim for a bit higher.

This means that, at least in the beginning, it's quite possible that one swing trade is earning you a bit over one of your current scalp trades. You will eventually aim for higher returns as you get a better feel for the market, so don't let this discourage you.

The other thing you should take into account are swap fees. These either work for you or against you, but they are definitely something you should be considerate of if your starting capital is small.

How did you do for the past 6 months? Was it a strategy issue (not profiting) or time issue (profiting but investing too much time) that made you want to switch?

In my opinion, the D1 and W1 are the best to make trades, and so swing trading.
Higher time frames have more information of and impact on the price.
Less is more.
Your will have more time for your self instead of looking at the charts for hours and hours, you will use limit orders what will give your more control of your risk management.
Day trading can be very stressful and it influences your successful trading capacity.
With higher frames you will make less trades per week or even days without any, but at the end of the day, the results don‚Äôt really depends on amount of trades but about your strategy win rate and R/R.
This is just my opinion, if you want too, give it a try.

This is what I'm trying to do. Have a demanding 9 to 5 so trading in the day is impossible.

I do something close to this, it actually brings peace

Can you clarify your first point, please? It seems a bit rambling and I‚Äôm not sure if you were trying to be condescending or helpful. Obviously a setup gets there when it gets there.  One or two is the maximum implied, not the minimum. If there‚Äôs no setup there‚Äôs no setup. What are you tring to tell me here?

As for number 2, again, what are you trying to tell me? That capital needs to compound over time? I could have told you that."

Daytrading,GBP/AUD Daily Timeframe (DTF) ‚Äì Fundamental and Technical Analysis,"echnical Outlook:  
  
On the DTF, GBP/AUD has broken above the second major key support level at 2.0600, following a period of consolidation between 2.0300 and 2.0600. Price then approached 2.0950, a minor resistance level, where it attracted retail buy orders‚Äîcreating a liquidity zone. Instead of a clean breakout, price action shows signs of a liquidity grab, triggering stop-losses from buyers.  
  
Currently, the pair is in a liquidity zone. We're waiting for a clean breakout above 2.10450, which could confirm a bullish continuation.  
  
However, we are not underestimating a potential downside move. If price breaks below the 1st major key support at 2.0300, it may signal a short-term bearish reversal‚Äîespecially if AUD gains momentum from the weakening USD and global risk sentiment favors commodity currencies.

Daytrading,Got my best career trade as of yet on Gold.,"Context: Gold has been extremely bullish these past few months. Every time it settles on a new All Time High it has a slight pattern of retracing into a weekly FVG b4 reversing back upward and making a new All Time High. Price was overall bullish on the weekly but was retracing and with a simple look at the chart I already had a damn good idea where price wanted to go which was the most recent weekly FVG and also the only FVG within that bullish extension, so I wanted to enter in there. I watched as price slowly targetted the weekly FVG and the asian session eventually tapped into it, but I still waited. Off the power of 3 rule I naturally assumed that another session(presumably the new york session) would sweep back the old asian session low and give me deeper contact in the weekly FVG. I waited to the next day and the New York session gave me exactly just that. I entered off a 15 minute break of structure and targetted previous session highs as my first TP. I set my stop below the weekly FVG and my first Take Profit at a past London high. I risked 1.5% to gain 1.5% roughly on first TP. I then waited around a day and half for my my first Take profit to get hit and the other TPs were hit subsequently after. I basically betted that I was catching Gold in its rebalancing/pullback act. All on demo btw to be clear. Just experimenting. Today price hit my last take profit which was the old all time high. Took around almost 3 days for all this to happen.

Daytrading,USD/CAD 4H Time Frame Analysis,"USD/CAD 4H Time Frame Analysis  
  
  
On the 4-hour time frame, USD/CAD has been in a prolonged consolidation phase following an uptrend. However, during this consolidation, we observed a subtle shift in market momentum toward the downside.  
  
Two key support levels have been identified:  
  
1.41800 ‚Äì First major key level  
  
1.39000 ‚Äì Next significant support level  
  
These levels will serve as crucial zones for observing future price action.  
  
Recently, a breakout occurred below the first major key level (1.41800), triggering pending sell orders from retail traders anticipating further downside. This move also signaled a Change of Character (CHOCH) in the market structure. However, before a full bearish move unfolded, market makers stepped in to absorb liquidity, hunting stop-losses to create more efficient trade flow within the liquidity zone.  
  
Now that liquidity has been collected, institutional traders are beginning to position themselves for a continuation to the downside. This is often when smart money‚Äîlarge, informed investors‚Äîstart executing their strategies after a prolonged price build-up.  
  
Trading Strategy:  
  
Sell Limit: 1.41660 (upon pullback or retest of broken support)  
  
Stop Loss: 1.43000 (above the liquidity zone)  
  
Take Profit: 1.38920 (next major key support level)  
  
We'll wait for a retest of the 1.41660 zone to confirm entry, following smart money concepts and liquidity dynamics.  
  
Fundamental Outlook:  
  
Recent Positive Developments Supporting CAD:  
April 8, 2025: Canada has been largely exempted from the U.S.'s newly imposed 10% import tariffs. While Canadian exports in steel, aluminum, and autos remain under existing tariffs, the broader exemption has helped support CAD strength, reflecting confidence in Canada's trading stability.  
  
April 7, 2025: The Canadian dollar gained 0.1%, trading around 1.42 per USD (70.42 U.S. cents). This appreciation stems from investor optimism regarding Canada's insulation from global tariff pressures, positioning the CAD more favorably compared to its peers.  
  
Recent Negative Developments Impacting USD:  
  
U.S. CPI (m/m): Forecast shows a decline to -0.1% from the previous 0.2%, suggesting weakening inflation momentum, which could influence the Federal Reserve‚Äôs monetary policy stance.  
  
Unemployment Claims: Expected to rise from 219K to 223K, signaling potential softening in the labor market, which may add downside pressure to the USD.

This was my first go at carefully choosing a stock premarket and exercising a day trade rather than just buying and holding for a couple of days for gains.

What happened here?

I bought a SPY put after it bounced off the high at open and passed below the open price at 9:57. I sold too early at 10:22. Still learning to be confident with winners. Tightened my stop too much too early.

Because 1 hr is when the volume rushes in . Around two hours after market opens price tends to settle downwards and consolidate because of people eating lunch etc , causing the drop

send me exact time and date of your trade. Also was it a day trade or swing

thats an impressive trade although a tends to correct aggressively as people start booking profits after news driven rally

your trades seem to be 1:5 RR and thats awesome but the dip at 5:00 am on your chart went for an OF to mitigate and it went up after, hiting 1:12 trade as per my analysis. Good trade btw

but then next day why did it keep going up?

It was day trade from pre-open to auto square off which happens at 3.20 indian time"
Daytrading,Question abobut OANDA.,"Email from Oanda to me

This might be a stupid question and I apologise beforehand. I'm fairly new to forex trading with a few months into paper trading and started out with joining a broker (Oanda) and connecting my bank account with them, but I'm not able to transfer funds to my account because of the following message. I provided my Social Security Number to them but for some reason it wasn't validated. I know that theyre regulated but is it safe to send a signed image of it to them ? Has it happened to anyone here before ?

Daytrading,Need Help,"
Hey guys,

I‚Äôm super new to trading I actually started learning last week and demo trading this week (it‚Äôs been rough) but I‚Äôm slowly getting the hang of it.

Anyways, I wanted to post this to ask y‚Äôall who are more experienced about your insight and guide me to whatever I might have missed here. As you guys can see I was targeting a short based off a rejection with that huge bearish candle (although there were two green candles in that lower FVG - does that mean anything in terms of disrespecting the FVG?) And I thought it would go down. Well, it did, but not where I wanted it to.

You see, I already highlighted the second FVG that I had in mind and it rejected off of there. How would I have known about this and what could I have done different and what am I not seeing?

Why wouldn‚Äôt I have just put a buy order once it fully disrespected the first FVG?

Sorry if I‚Äôm asking too much. I really look forward to someone helping me out. Thank you guys sm.¬†Ôøº",https://i.redd.it/eoy8gp1lnlle1.jpeg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1iz68od/need_help/,3,29,2025-02-27 03:17:58,IllKindheartedness30,"Funny how all the new traders go to ICT when he blew up publicly multiple times in the robbins cup. Michael Huddleston has admitted he‚Äôs made more money from his ‚Äúmentorship‚Äù than he ever did trading. You‚Äôll figure it out one day

This is more just general advice:  come up with a repeatable system or strategy, find as many examples of that strategy playing out as you can, do the math on if it makes sense.  Looks like you were trying to sell a pullback in a downtrend, that's a good start.  Define a trend, then define a pullback, then figure out the math that makes this a winning strategy.  If fvg is the way you define it, good enough, just make sure you've tested this to the point you have reason to believe it works. 
 YouTube is good for generating ideas and learning when you know nothing, but to have any hope of success you need to test ideas enough to either prove them wrong or believe in them.  What you did in this trade MIGHT be  really good strategy, but I doubt anyone on this forum will see it how you do and or actually test it to the point of proving it one way or another.
After you backtest this 100+ times, you'll be a better trader, and will be one step closer to having a winning strategy.

Imo, you're forgetting basics:


1. Do not chase.¬†


The first FVG you entered at is too shallow of a pullback to actually be a pullback. You're chasing, and the reason you don't chase is precisely because it leaves you vulnerable to the real pullback if it comes.


Of course, sometimes it does run away from you, being an extremely powerful trend from a higher timeframe, but in general, know that it's a risk you're taking.


2. Why wouldn't you have just put a buy order when it fully disrespected the first FVG?


Because you're in a very obvious downtrend with clear lower lows and lower highs. Fully disrespecting the first FVG doesn't change the design at all, and it's still going to look like downtrend mode to everyone.

So did you take a ""loss"" on this trade?

Enter your trade with your risk/reward ideology in place and have a definitive stop out level

Don‚Äôt know if this is frowned upon but I‚Äôm new to trading as well (say new coming onto second year) and I‚Äôve been learning a strategy made by a guy called Sebastien Dubois, he‚Äôs got a mentor company thing called FX Academy (was called FXCartel). He‚Äôs got some pretty decent videos on YouTube for free. Had loads more but recently deleted them because now think he was giving away too much good insight for free.

My advice is always check on news before placing a trade, news data is a lot and it‚Äôs always good to know when you should and should not place trades based on your time zone, and for strategies I would say observe your levels, you could call it areas of resistance etc, and consistency.

That FVG created by the large red candle will 100% be filled.  FVGs have a massive retest rate. Has enough accumulation occurred for a a distribution phase back to the FVG?  Very possible.

I didn‚Äôt even know who ICT was tbh lol I just watched a lot of videos and saw ppl swearing by this strategy. Wat do you suggest ?

Thanks man. I appreciate the advice, especially at a time where I feel lost cuz theres so many strats so many ways it gets confusing. Thx"

You don't do anything. It didn't meet your criteria so you didn't take it, job well done. There'll be countless moves like this that you're not part of because they don't meet your criteria.

Your job as a trader is to build a system that stacks the odds in your favor and then simply follow it, because you *know* it stacks the odds in your favor. 

Anything outside your tested system has completely unknown odds. Sometimes a trade won‚Äôt set up but will go the way you were looking to go. Just think of it as none of your concern, none of your business. All you care about are *your* setups.

So, don‚Äôt chase price simply because it went the way you wanted to go but didn‚Äôt give a setup. Choosing to chase it, I can pretty much guarantee, will net an overall loss over enough time.

It‚Äôs a success because 1. I didn‚Äôt gamble 2. I was right

Roll into the fetal position and cry

Let it go...don't chase...

Not be in the trade and wait for my setup with that criteria. If this is something that happens often, find the consistency and have separate entry criteria for another setup and start testing.

Well. You win some, lose some, and miss some trades.

That‚Äôs normal spread. As others have stated, some brokers offer raw spread + fixed commissions, but I don‚Äôt think any do in the US that are regulated, but may be wrong. Do not trade with an offshore account to try to get raw spreads, that‚Äôs a bad idea. 

If you can‚Äôt find a regulated raw spread account, then simply move up a timeframe or two. For example, if you trade the 1min, trade the 5min instead. If you trade the 5min, trade the 15min instead. It will increase the number of pips in your SL, which means spread will be less of an issue. And you can lower your trade size a bit to keep the risk the same as what you‚Äôre doing now.

I've been learning ICT for about 2-3 months now, and after finishing the main important stuff (PD Arrays, Risk Management, +wayy more) I decided to start live testing some trades! Today was my 4th live trade which went really really well, and im going 3 for 1 against the market!

Here's a little paragraph that I journaled:  
Entered the trade at 13:35 off the price wicking all the way down in a Order Block. Initially was gonna wait for the price to break structure to the upside since we broke structure to the downside after being in an uptrend but I think it was a fakeout to have a reason to fill more orders in the OB. Entered off the price wicking into the OB. I think the leg down prior to my entry was just a retracement as we‚Äôre bullish on the 4h and daily. No news for GBP, just CPI for JPY.  
15:09 Trade won, I could have entered earlier but I wasnt at my pc when the candle wicked into the OB.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ieeoom/proud_of_this_trade_i_took_today/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1ieeoom/proud_of_this_trade_i_took_today/,0,10,2025-01-31 13:24:17,Eduard_Lovinescu,"Do you guys have an ict subreddit? I suggest keep ict stuff over there.

ICT advocates no indicators and for good reason. But after awhile I find that having indicators helps alert me to moves I want to take. I think you might not have missed the move if you had a RSI indicator there telling you that price is no longer oversold. Then you would go in to see that price respected the orderblock and is poised to go higher.

Great trade man. Keep the work up!

Open to any critiques and advice btw guys :D

A good trade is a good trade man, who cares if it‚Äôs ICT

Cheers man, means alot!

Oop would get way more feedback about their ict technique on an ict subreddit if it exists. 

Like if I have an orderflow question I‚Äôd probably ask it on the futures or order flow subreddits because that‚Äôs where order flow traders are.

Thank, finally someone with common sense

Ahh yes I see what you‚Äôre saying. Sorry I‚Äôm just so used to ppl getting angry that ppl trade ICT lol. I agree with you

I think yt trading teachers have the same stigma as car salesmen or probably worse. Like charlatans. 

So ict gets lumped into this category by association

With that said, if the ict learning info is free on YouTube and people are learning from it and it‚Äôs working for them then I don‚Äôt see a problem with it. Enjoy and good luck!"

So far from what I understand, is that I need the forex to gain 10 pips and then sell, however if I lose 10 pips I should also sell to minimise loss.

I‚Äôm going to use OANDA as a broker and trading view to see the actual movement

I am planning to learn the basics and practicing this a lil bit.

Dont get me wrong but before u go ahead and do this I think u should slow down and have a different approach. U barely starting and are just learning about trading/scalping and ur already aiming to do 1% a day, when in reality the main goal of any beginner should be to preserve capital and not lose any money or lose the least amount possible. I know ur not gonna follow this, but heres my advice, drop down all these expectations of X % per day, ‚Äútrading for a bit of money on the side‚Äù and seriously start studying, learn either of the many types of trading strategies there are, Id go with price action but u can choose whatever fits ur personality and liking, and then practice practice and practice more, develop ur own system and ideas about executing trades and only then deposit a small amount, I would go as far as saying 10% of ur 4K¬£ and lose it over few times and once u start showing some positive returns over time u can go ahead and deposit the full amount and start making some decent profits, again I know this isnt gonna happen, but unless ur an enlightened rare case of human being ur most likely to lose all ur initial investment just like over 90% of traders do when starting. This is a marathon, not a sprint. GL

Never count the money before it's in your hand.

If you put pressure on yourself making x amount a day you will end up losing. Try to instead focus on one good trade a day.

>So what I want to do is to trade with my full ¬£4000 on the forex EUR/USD to get a profit of 1% or ¬£40 All I want is ¬£40 profit per day

""All I want is a 1% return per day, which works out to just a measly 1100-3700% per year""

""So far from what I understand"". And thats it, you dont understand anything yet. Learn the skill first, then try to make money. Everybody had the same idea before. ""I just want to make 20$"" and then learned the hard way. Chances are very very high you will lose all of your 4000$. There is 10 pips of EURUSD trade multiple time of the day. I would highly recommend you to first Learn the basic, trade at least 1-2 months on a demo account before even considering putting 1$ of your hard earned money in a live account. There a plenty of good videos on youtube to learn trading its just a matter of how serious you are about this

So you want to Play in the pro League eithout any knowledge ?

Rest in Peace Money 

Look If you wanna be scalping you habe ti understand the Market, how ITS breathing how ITS Working 

And as far you understood These you can Go from Higher time frame to lower be BE prepare the lower you are going tge more difficult it will BE in the lower area do you mess with AI and Institutions 

If you really new, forget scalping 

First understand What the Market so
Second build of thus information a strategy 
Third If this strategy Working for longer than Go a bit down with time frame and Test ist further 

Until you are in the Low area

Trade minimum possible amount 1 nanocontract or whatever you have on your platform to ensure that you strategy works long term. If you profitable for a month - increase you position a bit. If you losing for a week - decrease your position and regroup.  
Have a trading diary. Put you trading reports here. What you did good. What you did wrong, What setups you miss, What setups you shouldn't have touched. e.t.c.  
The longer you trade the better you become, so your goal is not to lose your account in the first 3 years, which is usually the amount of time it takes people to become consistently profitable.

first just trying to follow the big fihes whos made 65 k in a day  1% is esy i think its just luck looking a lot video and stuffs like that

Pure price action but get rid of that target per day mindset. Dont limit urself to how much u can make a day and how much u can lose a day."

	‚Ä¢	Low or no commissions
	‚Ä¢	Reliable and fast market orders
	‚Ä¢	A solid charting tool

Currently, I‚Äôm looking at Robinhood, Webull, and OANDA:

	‚Ä¢	Robinhood: Commission-free and has a new charting platform I like.
	‚Ä¢	Webull: Commission-free and compatible with TradingView.

I do plan on manual trading, thanks for the advice. Also, judging by your username I assume you use a Trading bot, if so, how has it been going for you, do you have any past coding experience or could I use chat GPT to write code for a bot, and would you recommend automated trading over manual trading?

Yeah,California

My algos receive realtime news and stock market data and can be trading hundreds of tickers per day.  I couldn‚Äôt possibly beat my algos manually trading.

So many thing Can go wrong , power outage , network failure, flash crash , freeze on broker side , fucked up mentality taking over "" it will reverse , it will reverse "".

Just use a safety stop loss if you like to close yourself , or use a daily losses limits on broker side with auto liquidation.

I'm not saying you are a shit trader because it's nonsense, every body is a shit trader until he becomes a good trader.
However looking at the first picture, to me it's a bad entry. 

I dont know what candle you see but it's bullish in the zone and you are shorting at the unformed downtrend pattern, this may end up badly. This is easily going up again. 

You may be making a mistake that you want to catch the downtrend early, but the best trader don't catch the top, he looks for the downtrend and hang onto the wave.

Finally, not using a stoploss is a rookie mistake, if you think you can ""mentally"" stop the trade, you're gonna have a bad time...

Good trading is not gambling. Don't listen to him. But you can always improve your odds and your strategy by working on your setups so just keep at it.

Everything in trading is gambling - no one knows where the price will move next - but it's also a probability game - you choose and stick to a strategy that is consistently profitable.

Don‚Äôt listen to your friend. That‚Äôs your first mistake. As a trader it is you against the market. No one else matters unless they are helping you. Trade a strategy that makes more profit than it loses. That‚Äôs all that matters and you can‚Äôt really accurately find that out with an alt like jasmy because you don‚Äôt have historical data. Backtesting with crypto is not going to be easy unless it‚Äôs a major like btc or eth for this reason also. I wouldn‚Äôt be trading jasmy like that. Don‚Äôt be too technical based and short term. 

Look into the alt cycle and relative strength. When BTC pumps, capital will rotate to alts. Figure out which alts had relative strength to BTC and target those when you think the local bottom is in. Watch videos from Charlie BTC on YouTube is my biggest piece of advice here. Using what he calls spaghetti charts, you judge when BTC is peaking and then which of the strongest alts will follow suit as people take profits and rotate capital to alts. 

The flow goes something like this BTC > major alts (eth, sol, XRP, etc) > minor alts > meme coins > shitcoins. Then a big flush of liquidity and leverage, BTC corrects to the downside then eventually at some point the cycle begins again, assuming we are still in a bull market. 

When BTC moves 5% the alts will move bigger. So get out before the market turns on your alt bets. Telegram is invaluable. Look for alert pages like binance liquidation alerts, Bybit liquidations, trade copier TG groups (don‚Äôt copy but use them to judge what the big boys are doing). 

Avoid trading shitcoins at all costs and the less capital you have the more you should probably avoid trading crypto altogether and look at forex/futures. 

You can do very well in a bull by using whatever capital you can afford to lose comfortably, dividing it by 10 or whatever number and make a bet on 10 meme coins to hold for months until the market top is in (Coinbase being in the top 10 of the iOS store could be a top signal, or your non tech, non crypto friends asking about if they should invest in the frog coin, or your grandma suddenly asking if you know about crypto.) Just hold those meme coins to the end of bullish momentum and sell at a pre determined top signal. Do NOT just pick a very obvious arbitrary number, but maybe 3/4 of the way to one of those price levels, pull your initial investment and DO NOT fomo back in, DO NOT marry your bags. Be fickle, fast and dump all that shit. You can leave runner bags but be completely prepared for them to vaporize in an instant because more than likely they will once the market has reached a certain point. 

Good luckZ

Umm what is your strategy here?

Not saying you're a shit trader for this set up but definitely could do with perhaps picking your trades a little better maybe? Like in life they say chose your battles.

Number 1 never ever trade without a stop loss. As others mentioned a power outage or market outage, internet connection anything really can ruin your account. Never do that again risk management and capital preservation is Rule Number 1!

Secondly there is an impulse wave there on the left with strong buying. This consolidation pattern is obviously going to break 1 of 2 ways and really speaking you want to be trading the direction of the trend. You can scalp counter trend sure but make sure you're experienced enough for that and check other entry conditions.

Just a candle stick formation itself is not really good signal. I love to look at delta for potential reversals.

There isn't enough data really here to short that based on a short term rejection zone

Here are the things that can kill your account:

-Power outage

-Internet outage

-Computer outage

-Frozen stock screen (brokerage app or your computer)

-Huge bid-ask spread (check before buying)

-Slippage in sell limit price

-Market buy or sell order (specifically with large bid-ask spread)

-Miss the price sell to avoid minimal loss - loss suddenly increases 10x if stock continues to go against you

-Sell order refuses to be entered into the system due to brokerage app glitch

-Sell order does NOT get filled even after being successfully entered into the system

-any other tech glitches on the brokerage's end

The absolute BEST way to avoid a huge loss in either of these cases is to have at least 2 other devices open AND use extremely small number of contracts PER position, aiming for no more than 1% of your account!

Speaking of devices, ALWAYS have the brokerage app installed on your phone and have it open. If any outage occurs, your phone will still work if your phone plan includes the internet, so you can close your position there. Practice closing positions on all of your devices. 

 I never use stop loss, I simply use minimal portion per position.

Currencies, Gold and silver are difficult to predict. But your friend is wrong. Gambling is randomly betting without risk management. Trading is betting with risk management and with a sentiment that prefers one direction of a price move.

You can survive there only with good risk management. You can trade clear trend with sort of trailing stop or daily adjustment of your stop loss, but consolidation as that on the screen could have a breakout to one or another side in every single second. Some news come out, events, business figures, unexpected inflation or unemployment figure and the price could go anywhwere.

Maybe not on commodities with clear supply and demand structure...

Exit was based off of signs of momentum slowing down/buyer side inefficiencies, meaning institutes don't have enough interest from others including retail traders causing less efficient buying power which can cause pull backs and ineffective attempts to keep pushing upwards (if that makes sense).

This can be seen more clearly here. More red candles started too form and not long after 3 small green candles which indicates a lack of interest. You will see similar instances after price has a huge spike after news, followed high pushing highs and forming many of these smaller candles before dumping. Confirmation of this would be the larger red candle after price attempted to push higher which is when I exited my position. I did short here too but did not stay in it due to seeing the Gold opportunity and knowing the short trade here could earn me another 5% but only as a short trade and would be a failing trade if I wished for anymore downside unlike the high potential of the Gold trade. Sorry for yapping. Hope this helped explain.



Gained 29% on my account off this trade. Hope it taught someone something.

I also jumped into a XAU/GBP long swing  @ 2,083.289

Did this based off the similar candle formation you can see on the daily, not only that but we have seen large amounts of accumulation after the major sell side imbalance and consolidation (lack of buyer/seller interest). after the consolidation, you can see the buyer side is still stronger than sell side due to 5 red candles having to undo the work 4 green candles did (probably sounds silly).

https://preview.redd.it/d2o4qzl3g38e1.png?width=1772&format=png&auto=webp&s=540e4f273e2a63ab9bafc8dd2cb229d4b7fa3d3c

I expect to see 2,120 on Monday with a nice green candle and continuation to upside.

This is a common occurrence after experiencing a sell-side imbalance. It is when large institutes accumulate many, smaller positions over a longer period of time which is often followed by a breakout and large momentum to the up-side.

Candles like this, in this context usually indicate a momentum shift, hence why I jumped in.

Large 9% SL used in this trade due to the 80% gain potential I see in it, This is only due to it being a high reward swing trade.

Can you explain how the green bars you point to signify large institutions placing relatively small orders? They look like a few of many ordinary green bars to me.

If you made 29% you had way too big size. Unless you were using 0DTE then maybe it was ok.

1. You are buying in a downtrend, based only on the context of 5m, always focus on the higher timeframes, only take the position on the lowers.

2. Again, remember the trend is your friend. Don‚Äôt try to catch those little movements in between, they are not worth it if you are still trying to be profitable.

3. You are pointing that tp based on what? Remember to be realistic on your analysis and based on the time and volume of the session that you are trading.

Why long in a clear  downtrend üò≠

why did you buy when the market is trending down?

Solid trade, two critiques from me, but it seems to just be a loser. 

I personally would have waited for the dip back into the order block instead of entering w/ the fvg, which the market did retrace to, but it would have stopped you out anyway.

Also given that it‚Äôs a bearish trend and bias I would have waited for a bearish signal and gone short instead of trying to catch the ultimate reversal. The trend is your friend. 

An entry could have been at that bearish liquidity sweep and break of structure in the place you got stopped out, you can see it came back in and is potentially forming an order block to go short.

[deleted]

I would have shorted to go with the dowward trend. The lower highs and lower lows are still being created.

I would have only considered a reversal if there was at least 2 bottoms creating a level of a support.

If the yellow line was a previously defined keylevel, yeah, I can see how that looks like a potential area for buyers to come in which looked like it wasn't enough to sustain the direction as more sellers said f it, i'm selling off.

I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs a downtrend, i need to know how to identify the direction of the trend i looked at the 1h 4h D TF and it looked bullish(higher highs higher lows) i don‚Äôt understand why it is bearish, is it because of this 4h BOS?

Spread. Enable the Bid/Ask on the chart to see the spread.

Don't trade before asian open, spreads go wild at this time.

That‚Äôs why you trade futures..

My reddit execution is on par with my trading execution

the price went down to your stop loss but it did not stay there long enough for the order to execute, and so when it didn't execute, the stop loss order stayed waiting for the price to go down again which it didn't,  very common occurrence when using stop loss orders on a narrow window, and a highly volatile stock.  not much you can do about it except watch the stock price constantly and manually execute the order

Also a follow on trade you could look for the next day, because Wednesday  closed as a first red day (signal day) has to break a previous daily level to be a valid signal and how it setups on the next day is important too‚Ä¶ this was the high of month level it broke so even better.

**My first trade idea - Josh - 33 years old** üë¶

¬£100 equity could get you very far. Or not, and you might lose everything :)

XAU/USD significantly broke an ascending parallel channel (in purple) on the 1-hour chart today, creating an opportunity to go long.

Gold bounced off the support/resistance zone around $2714 with increased volume, forming a double bottom with clear buying pressure at this level.

There is also an approaching bullish MACD cross, and the RSI moving average has crossed, supporting the technical outlook (circled blue).

The technicals are further bolstered by strong fundamentals. Interest rates are coming down and are expected to continue declining. While there may be pauses in rate cuts and some promising economic data releases that could temporarily dampen the price of gold, this will only delay the precious metal‚Äôs ascent as rates eventually return to 2%-3%.

Safe-Haven Status: Gold has historically been an excellent hedge against inflation. Although inflation is now fading rapidly, the S&P 500 and NASDAQ have each appreciated around 20% year-to-date, compared with an average annual gain of 8%-12%. This means many investors are rebalancing portfolios, increasing demand for gold. This type of behavior can become self-fulfilling‚Äîas demand for gold and risk-off assets rises and demand for stocks decreases, both rallies and corrections can ensue.

Geopolitical Tensions: War has returned to the Middle East and Europe, and it appears to be escalating. With each retaliation and provocation, risk-off assets like gold tend to appreciate.

Money Printing: The Federal Reserve has been increasing its balance sheet through large-scale quantitative easing. This devalues the dollar, which, in turn, supports a rise in XAU/USD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1gavqwx/xauusd_swing_trade/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1gavqwx/xauusd_swing_trade/,1,3,2024-10-24 05:55:21,C137-Josh,"[deleted]

Daytrading,Further Examples of Support and Resistance,"About a month, I shared some basic examples of how to utilise [Support and Resistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1fpjzb0/understanding_support_and_resistance_lines/) on Reddit. Gotten a number of DMs from traders for more examples. I've been busy monitoring my own forex algo but I spotted some further examples to share here.

As a recap:

1. The key mistake is most traders look at 5M - 15M timeframe (TF). Those lines tend to be noisy and untested. The minimum you shoud look at it 1H timeframe. Once you get more experience, you could consider doing 15M
2. Find a level with most rejection or contact points. When you have more than 3 contact points, the more valid it is.

Giving two examples:

**22 Oct 24 03:00 (Hong Kong time)**

XAU/USD idea

https://preview.redd.it/vzh7xfqmoiwd1.png?width=1193&format=png&auto=webp&s=8e95577122704d60b5eb76ef788449b03d4144c8

Gold price revisited price of $2,714 which was previously a nice suppport and resistance zone between 18 Oct 13:30 to 19 Oct 01:30. You can see how well the price was hovering around the price and bounced off it. I counted a total contact point of 4, solidfying that zone.

https://preview.redd.it/pkibc17hoiwd1.png?width=2475&format=png&auto=webp&s=58f231efe533e1272b4d4d54332df72be7be224b

The placement of SL is crucial, place it below the previous wicks were and give it some buffer. You do not want it to be taken out so quickly just to see the price reversed upwards.

**22 Oct 24 03:00 (Hong Kong time)**

GBP/USD idea

https://preview.redd.it/q5kmzuwbriwd1.png?width=2459&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3bcd8cea787a1807eca11190c90a6d3b70186c

Cable retraced back to 1.298 level and it was proven to be a very strong support level previously. It took a long while before it bounced back up again. For this trade idea, SL needs to be longer to accomodate the longer wicks previously, still, it would be a nice R:R return.

Yeah 15m can work doesn‚Äôt have to be 1h. More contact points isn‚Äôt necessarily good if the order strength is running out, like if it‚Äôs an ascending triangle. It‚Äôs really about supply and demand right

Hey, thanks for sharing! Where is the swing trading sub and is this not considered day trading?

Since forex is open 24 hours, maybe any trade held less than 24 hours is a day trade. I noticed you used two 15m charts, not the 1 H as you recommended earlier. So 15m works for you too?

Yeah, my trades tend to close out usually within 2 - 3 hours. I thought it's appropriate to be posted here. 15M is the lowest I'll go for manual trades! However, I do believe higher timeframes tend to be more stable and better for beginners.

Daytrading,how do you handle taxes as a day trader living in the US?,"specifically i trade forex using oanda and my understanding is that they actually don't send any tax forms to clients or communicate with the IRS lol.. 

now, the IRS can still audit bank accounts and look at money that is being deposited into your account due to oanda withdrawals and question whether taxes are being paid on this or not

so eventually when you go to withdraw there will be a record in your bank account of you getting the funds

from what i understand, the way you are supposed to do it is every time you make a profitable trade you need to set aside some money from the trade to pay taxes on it

i'm wondering how many people do this though because the concept just seems silly

if you're starting out and building your trading capital, any gains you make you're going to want to re-deposit that back into your trading account to build your capital and trade bigger positions

so having to capital gains tax on these profits before you reinvest it just seems straight up dumb and i wonder how many people are doing that lol

i can understand if you're trading forex as your only source of income

in that case, you should withdraw however much money you need to live and pay taxes on that. anything in excess you put it back into your trading account to build up your capital

if you are trading part time and have a job that covers all your living expenses, you could withdraw enough profits to cover the expenses for your business. that way your business sees a small gain just so it looks like you've earned some money for the year

the rest of the money you just put it back into your trading account to trade with lol

of course you would have your emergency fund which is a separate thing and don't need to build that up anymore

essentially any extra money you make would be put back into your trading account

the only issue tho is the IRS could technically audit your bank accounts and see you're receiving all this money from your broker and wondering if you paid taxes on it lol

idk

it's either that or pay taxes on every withdrawal that you make which is what they want you to do

that's so dumb though because you should be reinvesting all the money anyway to build up your capital lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1g571em/how_do_you_handle_taxes_as_a_day_trader_living_in/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/1g571em/how_do_you_handle_taxes_as_a_day_trader_living_in/,4,17,2024-10-16 18:54:45,nervomelbye,"OANDA should be sending some paperwork but if they don't I imagine it's under your info come tax time. You can request it from them as well.

I withdrawal 60% of my gains to pay bills‚Ä¶.  Of the other 40%, I leave I. The margin account to leverage until tax time‚Ä¶.  30% of gains should go to taxes and that 10% just helps my account grow‚Ä¶. But compounding gains off of what I will owe on taxes is the best strategy I have found to work for me‚Ä¶

I pretend like the IRS doesn‚Äôt exist. Because they don‚Äôt care about someone with under $1million.

They‚Äôre so backlogged it would take 4 years for them to catch up.

i checked oanda's site: https://help.oanda.com/us/en/faqs/tax-filing-and-forms.htm

>OANDA does not report taxes on behalf of our clients, and as such, we do not provide any tax forms relating to profit/loss on your account (e.g. 1099-B form). Your annual account statement may help you with your tax reporting. You can download your annual account statement from the HUB by clicking on Statements .

so... if they don't even communicate or send anything to the IRS at all, then what now lol

the way they want people to do it is after each profitable trade, pay the taxes on it

this assumes you are consistently profitable and can be overall profit for the year

in this case they'd want ppl to pay the estimated quarterly taxes instead of paying all the tax at the end of the year

the way that makes sense to me is use however much profits to pay for your living for the year, then list this as your business profit and pay tax on it

the rest of the profits don't list it and just reinvest it back into your trading capital

idk if you're allowed to do that though, prob not

the alternative is mega stupid though, paying capital gains tax on each withdrawal of a profitable trade, even if you're gonna end up reinvesting that money back into your trading capital. just lol

That‚Äôs crazy, Oanda does do sus shit, I tried to close my account for the longest time and I had linked a savings account to it to fund it and that savings account closed and they don‚Äôt let me update the banking info so I had like $100 there that I figure is $0 now because they kept charging $10/month for ‚Äúinactivity fee‚Äù. Anyway I looked through my archives and for the brief time I used Amp, they provided something so idk if Oanda on the up and up.

Anytime you sell a stock that‚Äôs what you pay taxes on.

Not when you move it from the brokerage to your bank account.

that's futures

oanda in the US you can only trade spot currency pairs

you can't even trade gold on oanda in the US, just eur/usd, aud/usd, etc

i'm trading forex, not stocks

with stocks they actually issue you reports and your brokerage sends the forms to the IRS, i even think for that there is a way your accountant has to report the trading activity on your tax return. not sure if your accountant would do the same for forex trades, need to speak to mine regarding this"

update: the two trades i took on this are working out well

trading during a trend is pretty simple, from my limited experience

the issue that really screws people over is trading during a trend reversal, that one is a real test of skill

i think during the first 2 weeks of every month when news comes out you typically will see a trend reversal

trading during that is really difficult though, really really difficult

my current trade: https://i.gyazo.com/744e65b3ac448fada759e86d7f587232.png

this is textbook... https://i.gyazo.com/a71e27c42255e07e911773c7aa144567.png

rally, 50% retracement, then rally again equal height of the previous rally

if only more people knew about trading to make money lol... 15% of forex traders are retail people, even though you can literally just trade these charts and make your living that way

Monday sets the opening range of week, and it expanded the range from Fridays closing range, 
Tuesday typically will be when larger range expansion occur (initial balance)

So you if it continues the trend tomorrow will be a day it‚Äôs more likely to expand the range 100-200%

Another thing to note it‚Äôs closed in breakout 3 days in a row.. that can lead to big explosives, either large reversal or blowoffs in the direction of the trend. Good luck bro. I‚Äôll be looking to take a position in it tomorrow.

Depends if my setup presents :)

why not just take a position now with a limit order

Because my setup isn‚Äôt there.. I will know by tomorrow by how the first sessions play out, I was going to take a position today but chose gold as my template presented on that with much higher potential pip return, which it did work out to be.

what's your set up

Various ones, 3 session setups, 3 day setups, sometimes  signal days like FRD, FGD inside days etc
Prefer reversal trading but also take the trend breakout trades for range expansions, all the setups involve a pump and dump template, only focus on the parabolic moves, that go from high or low/ closing price to the of day to low or high of day week or month etc.

It‚Äôs all focused on timings at levels and behaviour of price. 

3 levels of rise or fall before the timing windows.

3 levels may be 75 pips or 150 pips or 300 all depends on the instrument.

would not just place a limit order at the next opportunity"

The key level should be retested after price has made a significant move away from it(key level) Patterns are not established by 3 candlesticks

I made my money going long off of that bottom. I seem to remember there was a double bottom and then a higher low, looks like a triple bottom but not quite on lower timeframes. There was some good rsi divergence on the 5m around that double bottom so I waited for a squeeze and got in. Still going up now!

Edit. I traded NQ so it might look a little different on Nas100

On the 1 minute chart it's a double bottom. On the hourly it's a big wick. Look at it with multiple time frames and it's easier to figure out.

Just my opinion , from my understanding, when i look for patterns i look for an actual W or an M. That looks like support on the 15m but what does it look like on a lower TF?

on other time frames, it should count as a double bottom. 

on 15 minute, consolidating in a range those 3 bars. Building a decent case for a long. i tried to get long around here myself, but I watched the 1 minute only. it worked quite well

Maybe on the 1 min timeframe it's a triple bottom, but 3 candles in a row tapping the same level isn't a triple bottom on the 15 min chart. It needs to come into the level reject, and then come back and reject, and then come back and reject one more time to be a triple bottom.

yes can be

...

that is neither a double, nor a triple bottom.

i think you need to stop trading and spend a few months just studying

I don't use much TA, I have learnt from just watching this stuff print for 8-15 hours everyday for the past 2/3 weeks. Now reason why I am here is because I would like to give some advice which has helped me. 

  
1. Make notes of your mistakes. I have notes in front of me and on my wall above my monitor. These are mistakes that I make which are common. All mistakes I make are jotted down for me to read regularly.

2. trust your calls, let your SL hit, don't be afraid to be wrong but you must trust your original judgement.

3. Find a reason to exit your position, TP are good cause it removes the interference of emotions and greed but finding a reason to exit your positions I believe can make you a better trader although you must monitor your trades constantly. 

4. Learn self-discipline. You will NOT make it far if you do not learn self-discipline. I make myself uncomfortable by being cold and workout to get warm. Clean your rooms/house. This will help. Self-discipline is defined by doing something you don't want to do, when you don't want to do it. 

I still make mistakes, stupid ones but I am learning and you can and will. The mistakes I make are becoming alot less common and good trades and predictions based off experience is increasing. 

Learn how the market moves and reacts in whatever you trade, beware of news and seek constant growth. 



You will make it if you don't give up. Keep pushing and you will achieve your goals. Hope this helps.

It‚Äôs up trending. Buy the dip. What made you buy in at the point you did?

[removed]

Well since we know when you entered from your last post we can see that you waited it out (fair enough though because it didn't hit your SL and you also didn't move it further down - good job)

You added to your winning position (I assume when price rose over your entry and you got confidence in your trade)

And you let your winner run and it's probably still running.

All in all not bad since you trade in the right trend direction. About your entry and when you added - you can work on that. What I would've done differently:

1. You've drawn yourself a solid trendline - why are you not using it? Your entry should be after the trend continuation (bounce off of the trend line). Look out for confirmation candles but don't wait too long since price can rise without you and leave you behind. Look on a lower timeframe for a better entry if price tends to move without you.

2. Don't be afraid to add to a losing position if it's still the correct trade. When I happen to get a bad entry I'll not scare away to add to my position on that point where I should've entered in the first place! In your case right around your trendline!! Usually I would never advise someone to do that exact thing but if you are confident that price will rise or fall (in whichever direction you're trading) it's not a bad move to add even though the position might be losing right now.

All in all you seem to have grasped the concept of price action. Work on your confidence to enter on a good point. In your example price is very very likely to rise further since it bounced almost perfectly from your trendline. If you have confirmation that price will likely rise further, what are you waiting for? Be aggressive and use these situations because that's where you'll make money.

Entry too late. Stop loss too wide

Just saw your post, and from the looks of it, your trade is riding a solid uptrend! You‚Äôve drawn a nice trendline supporting the price action, which looks like a good move. The buy limit is well-placed near the trendline, giving you a good entry point. The take-profit level also seems reasonable, right before resistance, allowing you to secure gains before a possible reversal. Just keep an eye on that support, and if it breaks, you might want to reassess your stop-loss to minimize risk.

If you‚Äôd like, I can share some resources that helped me refine my entries and exits early on!

Hey mate, just wanted to thank you for bringing this trade to my alert and full analysis. 

After reading the news and charts, I decided that AUDUSD was falling, and posted for advice about 15 hours ago. And since then, AUDUSD has dipped by 1.14%! Cheers mate.

it's gonna go up

i've been scalping this sht for 2 hours this morning, back and forth back and forth

as you can see, three higher lows have formed, during my scalping bullsht session

that's confirmation

put in a long order and now gonna just wait

i should be able to win that and get all my money back and then profit, then another day of the same bullsht with the scalps

look at my latest post

this is an older trade, it executed at take profit number, long position

Did you see it just broke below the previous high, forming a lower high and lower low? Its coming to my buy order price now.¬†

if you are trading on the weekly chart, I would understand your rationale. But you are scalping?¬†

I hate those days when catching profit feels like you‚Äôre trying to catch a slippery pig. And then in your head you‚Äôre like ‚Äúalright little bastard, I got you now‚Äù haha

I‚Äôve had the same issue with IWM today. Finally gave up after getting whipsawed several times

idk man, everyone trades differently

from my perspective, your trading seems off

you are saying a lot of stuff in hindsight, like you're trying to get in when the price is the absolute lowest, it's never gonna be like that and you'll only know that after the fact

not sure why you wanna keep hounding on price action that already happened

future price action is completely unknown

i trade on various time frames

i scalp when i can't tell what the market is doing

and if i can tell or a pattern starts to form, then i take a longer trade

i probably shouldn't scalp at all and just wait until i can take a longer trade, but i'm still new and learning. so i just decide to scalp and go back and forth for a few hours, usually resulting in losses

usually i trade in the mornings for a couple of hours, until i can put in a big long position, then just wait

but i work from home so i have the ability to trade even 4 or 5 hours straight in front of my computer if i want to. other people may not be able to do this so their trading strategies will vary

When the price was around this week‚Äôs high, you posted this as your entry, and then i said prices would be going down in order for me to enter.¬†

Then, prices fell and I updated you here. Which part of my first or second reply looks like hindsight to you?

From your explanation, you said you are new and you fully well that you probably shouldn‚Äôt trade, yet you decide to scalp for a few hours resulting in losses, sinply because you can afford the time? Is that what you are saying?¬†

Why don‚Äôt you devote the time to learning first?

But hey, the money is yours, i have no say in how you want to trade. Go ahead and do what you want to do, I have no intention of arguing with you. I merely posted out what I see and your defensive response tells me that there‚Äôs no point in debating. Im in the market to make money in trading, nothing else

gotcha

right now i'm actually trading on a demo account, so none of the wins or losses is real to me

my thing is that i'm trying to actually win, not lose

yeah scalping for a few hours is probly something i shouldn't do, or maybe i should do it, i'm not 100% sure

i'm still new and trying things out, seeing what works

you said you would enter if prices go down to the previous support level

yeah dude, obviously lol. everyone would do that.. there's no point to say that

the question is IF prices will go down to that level, maybe they will, maybe they won't

using past price action to dictate entry doesn't work imo. better off just entering and then setting a target based on your strategy"

You taken a short while price is going long, you‚Äôre just hoping it will reverse.

I would have waited for a larger reversal confirmation, too early for any confirmations for me. 

Plus you are going short while the last 10 candle have mostly been green. 

If you win this trade I feel like it‚Äôs still a bad trade that got lucky because of the info above 

Good luck tho ü§û

Me personally I would‚Äôve waiting for more of a confirmation before pulling the trigger. Could honestly run up and double top near your stop loss before it reverses back down.

Sorry for your loss bro

looks decent, you probably should of waited into there is some kind of slowing down in the spike before placing the puts

I will not comment about your specific position/trade, but you should really be more aware of macro factors that drive this pair and all of Forex. We are less than 24 hours into a 50bp cut by the FOMC. You have a BOE meeting ending in 2 hours, and then the BOJ meeting on Friday. That is some massive macro risk, that could take this trade in any direction at the drop of a hat. If you want to trade strictly on chart patterns, then going forward, try to do it during times with less expected random volatility.

These events can make the price gap significantly, which could mean your stop loss gets executed a lot farther away than you might imagine. It looks like your stop loss is at 1.32850? I would not be surprised if this gaps 1/2 a point or more through that, and you get a fill above 1.3300.

Why did you get in so early?

Upward trendline, higher highs and higher lows. Solid analysis and it hit TP but trading right before Powell speaks is gutsy.

why not?

thank you

your thoughts on this one?

https://i.gyazo.com/2f6507e2de48d05f87f908373ca1da2f.png

Because by going in so early you are still not in break even zone and your stop is retardly big compared to the trend. 

Like you even drew the trendlines. Couldve waited until it broke that line and start climbing up to place a bid to further minimize your loss zone

This one‚Äôs more riskier since the trendline support broke with momentum and it created a lower low. 

Would only take this if price went back down to the low and reacted with a double confirmation (bullish bar or pin bar).

what do you mean?

this is a 1:1 risk to reward ratio

yeah we'll see

what i've been doing is looking at 5 pairs and when i'm ready to  make a trade, check them all out and see which is in the easiest position to make a simple profit

ideally i'd like to get at least 20 pips of movement, but i'll take at least 10 pips if all pairs aren't looking that good..

I definitely wouldn‚Äôt have taken it. You should have taken one of the last 2 legs ups before it just starting sitting there.

I already caught the first big move of this uptrend and entered again in this consolidation. It still is maintaining a bullish structure, and the range is more likely to continue up when it is still in an uptrend (it hasn't broken the last higher low yet). That being said my new entry is only going with a 1:1.6 RR because I feel the trend will be over soon, looks like it has one last push and then I'll look to short it.

Stay out. Likely a liquidity sweep below support. I‚Äôm seeing a strong possible swing wick to the downside before continuing up. Wait for confirmation, do not take a trade.

Daytrading,Trade Review EUR/USD,"Recap on a trade I opened Sept. 6th, closed on the 10th.

May be a little hard to see, but the internal structure flipped back bearish after a mitigation of supply in the discount:

This led to a great entry at the newly formed supply zone of the internal structure, with the target being the current swing low (continuation of the 15m bearish structure). The internal structure continued all the way to our target:

No, it's not normal to take a picture of your laptop screen.

My 1 min chart for GBP/USD Oanda on tradingview looks smooth and normal, not sure what happened to yours.

Tradingview had an error on the data stream from oanda yesterday.  I trade Wti (oil) and from 15.15 cet, the oanda chart on tradingview slowed down, to lag 1-5 mins behind other brokers charts on tradingview.  It persisted for 45 minutes and during that time my chart got prints, like you se on yours.  When it was all corrected and data stream on tradingview normalized to normal time, prints got corrected.  I checked the Oanda mobile app during this time and it did not lag.  So it was a tradingview issue.  Funny thing is according to tradingview uptime monitor. Nothing was wrong at the time‚Ä¶(they don‚Äôt seem to count a broken, slowed data stream to a broker as a problem).

[deleted]

I saw the same thing yesterday, and my broker was moving perfectly fine, something might be wrong with tradingview or the OANDA Charts, anyone who trades with OANDA??

Mine did something similar today as well, for some reason, only on my trading view chart. I think my internet was glitching and it might have been that but it didnt do it on my charts on other websites, so probably something to do with tradingview bc its only happening there, but it might be triggered by your internet being laggy or slow

It looks like the market is thin. What time did this happen?

I see you are using the Oanda feed.  If you are using Trading View this means that their server retrieved the data straight from the Oanda server or a third-party data provider. This doesn't have anything to do with your hardware or internet connectivity. You can always load up the Oanda application and see if this looks the same. I know from experience that FX OTC brokers aggregate their data from multiple FX sources.

There is a big difference between trading with OTC FX and Futures Exchange."

That's exactly where buyers would step in if they are watching (and they were).

You should always place your stop based on market structure, ie: in this instance below previous price action lows. You can also see it tapped that moving average and got bought up, again, buyers would be at those levels.

The most important part of a trade is the exits (both stop and target). They need to be at logical levels to give the trade a proper chance at working out.

No way to predict it but a way to prep it to use structure those extra points in SL won‚Äôt hurt you if it means more wins that structure that started the moves would‚Äôve been a great spot for your SL a slightly bigger SL that you adjust your risk too never hurt anyone

One way to counteract this is make sure your sl has a buffer or a breather to avoid being liquidity hunted make sure your stop loss has a buffer and at the same time still adheres to your risk management plan to avoid over leveraging I've traded like this for like the past 18 months and it works wonders  once in a while you will get stopped out  but you'll win more on the trades that  you initially used to get wicked  out  on and went back to your direction.

That‚Äôs why you should always follow the trend with your stop loss

Research ""Orderblocks"". They are around for ages. If there is an orderblock below your entry it is best practise to put your stop below the orderblock, rather than inside or above it. They are very helpful tools.

Why do you guys not queehat ur told? Ur told that swings or pivots are support and resistance. 
Your told to use thrm as stoplosses.

And then u constantly get stopped out.

But nit one of u ever thinks to question HOW TO VALIDATE a swing.

Also if a swung is support or resistance, then why woykd u put ur stoploss there knowing price needs to bounce off support or resistance?

Your stop shouldve been at BE by the time it started to come against you.

The market is completely random, it might have been pure coincidence. Take a look of a number of your trades and then see if getting stopped out is common and if so, consider making adjustments.

Hi everyone, I have a winning strategy that works perfectly with me because i didn't look for any model and understood the markets by my own few years ago. I implemented it with some basic concepts and i was wondering if it has a name and if it's something common. Took me years to get it by myself so there's how it works:

\- I trade on XAUUSD  
\- Overlap between London and NY  
\- Top down analysis D - H4 - H1 - 30  
\- looking for 15min entry  
\- Identifying Support levels / Resistances  
\- Once i see if its bearish/bullish for the day i wait for a correction then enter long/short  
\- I use FIBO for TP and SL  
\- I enter after confirmations like Engulfing candlestick / liquidity sweep / BOS / FVG's and few more

Is there a name for that type of trading ?? I have a lot of traders i know that are asking me how i trade and i never new if it has a name and already exists ( for example someone that says he's trading ICT or whatever)

If the winning strategy brings in any money, call it whateva u like mateüòú

Your strategy is essentially a ""Smart Money Concept (SMC) + Price Action + Fibonacci"" approach, but there isn‚Äôt a widely recognized single name for it. As the other comment said, you get the privilege to name it :)

Out of Curiosity, how much have you made SHORTING gold vs LONG this year?  

I mean, are the bulk of your winning trades LONG or SHORT.  

We have been in an insane Gold Rush for a while now, the strategy might be called: A BULL MARKET

I‚Äôd call it a reversal strategy.

I was bullish for the last 2 years but now I think there will be a correction on the market. For 230 trades i have 36 that are SELLs and 194 other trades are on BUY. I have a journal that I made only to analyze the ratio of wins (the ratio does not include me entering and letting it run because I have closed way too many times before hitting TP or BE, it‚Äôs more of a supposition of how much I could have done if I let my trades run) and there‚Äôs a 77% win rate ratio on BUY all of them with a 3:1 RR and 1% risking per trade and 57% with 3:1 RR on SELL"

during distribution, smart money sells. they sell in preparation to buy back at lower prices in the later phases

Good thing it's only a demo account, right? Nobody would try catching a falling knife with real money after just 2 months experience, right?

Take the loss and learn. It could go back up or it could go much lower. Now you're gambling. Hope isn't a trading strategy. Trust me I've been there.

""i didnt set a stop loss because i thought it would drop a bit and then come back up and i didnt want to get stopped and watch it ride back up without me . ""

Rule 1, Set a predetermined stop loss before you trade.

Rule 2, follow rule 1 .

Rule 3 , follow rule 2.

Rule 4 , follow rule 3.

Please find a mentor

From my experience when I‚Äôm like thinking and hoping the price will do something, instead of waiting for a high probability setup, that‚Äôs when I have losing trade. We have to react to price and not predict. By being long you not just lost a long but also missed out on a short. So it‚Äôs a double edge sword. I like to write some explanation after every win or loss with like a lesson of the trade and save the screenshots. Than you look through them from time to time, and next time something same happens you will go short. Try to see the gaps as just a large trend bar. It can get recovered, but it can just as well be the spike breakout that start an all day trend. Good luck

Bro, that's really good for you to close the trade. Not being stubborn could make you going longer in this journey

Just saw your post, man, and sorry to hear about that 9% hit. Gotta say, not setting a stop loss is a common rookie mistake, but you‚Äôre not alone ‚Äì everyone learns this way early on. Gap fills aren‚Äôt guaranteed, so try not to rely on assumptions; always have a clear plan with risk management in place.

Before taking trades, practice having defined stop-loss and profit targets, and don‚Äôt trade on impulse. If you‚Äôre looking for more guidance, I‚Äôd suggest checking in with our community on Discord or making an appointment with my friend Daniel for solid advice. Let me know if you‚Äôd like more details!

I thought, I figured, I didn‚Äôt set up a stop loss,‚Ä¶ fomo,greed, gambling(a recipe for disaster) get out of that thing fast before I whoop you!

It's your trading account. Do what you feel is best. The gap will fill, one day. But is it worth your entire account balance to find out? No.

You should be risking 1-2% of your balance at maximum. Any trade you take you should be thinking about your stop loss before even thinking about TP targets. Without a defined logical stop loss area, the trade should never have been placed."

Who knows. Be prepared for such movements. No matter how close you watch the news, there will be times you will catch such drops with long-positions. üòÅ

Ah i see that, do these drops happen the exact moment that those news article is released? or it it something that comes out earlier that i can watch before hand to predict such drops?

Yes pretty much exactly when it drops. You do not want to try and predict these drops, that would be gambling. When you see CPI, PPI, FOMC, or any red folder you should be weary that the trading conditions might be extremely volatile and unpredictable. Make sure you use a stop loss if you decide to do it anyway.

Also, it is important you know how news affects pairs. The first currency in the pair will be affected in alignment with the news data (ex. If CPI was bad for GBP then price falls). However, say you are trading GBP/JPY and JPY has news that is positive for its currency, that will make GBP/JPY fall. This is because GBP is being traded against JPY.

Thank you for the insight, i looked at some details about that CPI on forex factory and it said that it drops monthly and usually drops 16 days after the month ends, which would line up with todays date, something I can look at/prepare for? Although it also says next release is Nov 20 so idk"

Trading,The interesting world of Japanese FX brokers.,"Hello there!

Well since I live in Japan I thought it might be interesting for some people to learn a bit about how a very particular but fairly big FX market functions for retail traders. First of all here in Japan, you have to choose between the domestic brokers which I'll talk about because they're quite interesting compared to brokers you see around online, and the ""overseas"" broker which are allowed but barely (it's more like tolerated). In fact, many brokers are not available to Japan residents because they don't want to potentially deal with Japanese authorities. The ones that do, (there are like a dozen I think?) are often regulated in Seychelles or Mauritius like XMTrading, ICMarkets Global, HFM etc. So we still have the choice, unlike US traders who are banned everywhere unfortunately. Few foreign brokers try to open up shop domestically. Notable names are Saxo Bank, Forex.com, Oanda and Dukascopy however.  
Anyway, I want to provide a glimpse into purely Japanese FX brokers because they offer trading conditions that might make your jaw drop, especially on YEN pairs.  


So we have big names like GMO, Minna no FX, Rakuten (which is also present in Australia), DMM or even LINE (yes the message application). They actually advertise fairly aggressively. I always hear about DMM FX or CFD in local convenience stores for example. Regulation is pretty tight, however and leverage is low (I think it's max 1:25 on major pairs). Landing on their home page is advertising no commissions whatsoever. OK so you might think that spreads are at least like 0.9 pips right?? Well no. USD/JPY notably is often advertised as having 0.2 pip only! Same (0.2) for the highly exotic MXN/JPY who rose in popularity due to the carry trade, something you'll NEVER find anywhere else... And the carry trade is often highly advertised, ""We have the best swaps!"" they say. This is because they cater to the famous ""Mrs Watanabe"" traders who just carry trade -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mrs._Watanabe  
Also one peculiar thing is that they often do not have Metatrader and rely on their own platforms. Some do advertise Metatrader though or more recently, tradingview.  
Another curious thing is Minna no FX for example advertising ""BIG lots up to 300 allowed""! Damn, some people must be balling!   Some even have really low spreads on EUR/USD or AUD/USD like 0.3. It's really surprising for a 0 commission account. Who knows, maybe it would be interesting for day trading or even scalping as this would be very very low cost.
I am not sure if those domestic FX brokers are market makers, STP or ECN. This is not really something they advertise but the fact that they're regulated in Japan make them extremely safe, generally speaking.

There you go, a glimpse into the local FX offering. I'm sure those are trading conditions that aren't found anywhere else tbh.",https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1frb30t/the_interesting_world_of_japanese_fx_brokers/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/comments/1frb30t/the_interesting_world_of_japanese_fx_brokers/,9,7,2024-09-28 10:08:41,romjpn,"This looks like a newbie/general question that we've covered in our [resources](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trading/wiki/index) - Have a look at the contents listed, it's updated weekly!

Hi, I don't live in Japan, but just out of curiosity, could you tell me something about the Fintokey prop company? It was born from the Purple Trading broker and after Japan, they are expanding their business in Italy and Eastern Europe. They claim to be very popular in Japan but it is difficult for me to find reviews from Japanese users. Thanks

[removed]

Honestly it's hard for me to say anything because you literally just made me discover them. I can't find anything blatantly bad about them when taking a look at what is said on X from a few Japanese users.  
Their instant accounts are cool though.

The COVID years were absolutely insane for this strategy, especially MXN/JPY longs but right now the cycle is turning back into JPY strength so it's time to downsize the position or close all of them.

If trading index‚Äôs, why not use a broker that gives you access to futures and move away from CFD‚Äôs and their nuances.

What are your financing costs as a percentage of your profits? 

Generally speaking, I would not think that financing costs/swaps or commissions would significantly 'eat away' the profits of a profitable system with a legitimate edge.

Anyone else? :$

eh. trade futures???

My profit over 3 years with all costs included is 25% and without financing costs(I believe its just financing) it would have been 12% more. 

I really feel this can be lowered? Should I switch over from cfds?

Thanks for your response btw

There are certainly methods to minimise financing costs, which will ultimately depend on your trading strategy - key considerations will include average holding time, whether you hold through the triple-swap roll-over, if your portfolio is predominantly long/short, etc. 

That being said, how much time and effort are you putting into this system/portfolio? At ~8.33% per annum - on a leveraged cfd portfolio - you might be better off buying and holding the  index (particularly if you are not utilising the leverage provided by your broker) or an ETF, which will likely match your current returns, if not exceed them (for instance, research the S&P500 historical benchmark), with lower fees (than the 32% you have paid over the past three years).

32%? 

And it‚Äôs very little effort, 1 min a day or so. But the way towards this method was long tho :-p but very fun to watch myself going from losses to breakeven to now in profit. Maybe the financing costs are a little skewed, because I‚Äôm counting from my current strategy that changed everything, I‚Äôve been trading for a long time, financing costs are probably lower than I said, but still to high for my liking and the question still stands. 

Holding the index/etf doesnt cost anything?

I really like how my trading is going, but I feel there must be a way to cut costs, don‚Äôt think I want to abandon ship just yet ;))"
Trading,How do retail Forex broker 'spreads' come into play when I place an order? (Forex),"I understand that the spread is the difference between the current best BID price and the current best ASK price. But I don't understand how retail brokers add their own spreads.  


For example, at this moment, Oanda says their spread is 0.8 for AUD/USD. So, considering the following scenario, how much would I pay to Buy a currency pair?  


Scenario, AUD/USD:

\- Current BID price: 0.6383  
\- Current ASK price: 0.6387  
\- So the spread is: 4  


When I Buy 1 lot AUD/USD, what do I pay? Where does the broker's extra 0.8 spread come in?  


And what about selling? If I wanted to Sell 1 lot AUD/USD?

Trading,XAUUSD Update," Hello again guys, after XAUUSD made 3 unsuccessful attempts to break the 1904 level, I think that it's time to short this market. Of course my short position from yesterday is already closed at a small plus ! So now here I am looking for some short candlestick like shooting star or engulfing candle.It will also be good if we look at the five-minute chart where we want to see a break of the 1900 level, then a retest. The target of this move is to be the bottom of this range ,namely 1885,and we are likely to make a big wick down ,because there is a lot of news today! I am not a financial advisor ! Good luck!  Stay profitable!

Maybe it's just building up enough juice to break through?

Or maybe the price of the gold doesn't change and the USD does?

the fact that gold is now making a break above 1904 does not mean that it will not go down to 1885 to skim liquidity.As I wrote before around 1900$ I expect manipulation.But so far we have not had a short signal !!!

I don't follow gold so I just checked. It had a wick up a couple hours ago which looks like a failure. But it hasn't broke down yet either.

USD has broke out so far today but the day is not over so it could end at a wick out as well. Needs another day. It does look strong though."
Trading,XAUUSD," 

Hello guys, I continue to be sick, but as you know money never sleeps or rests. This is gold 1H timeframe. We broke above the trendline with multiple green candles, but the bulls continue to be weak, unable to overcome the 1904 level. After seeing that the bulls have no intention to make a breakout and a shooting star followed I opened my short position (second picture). Now here the options are two .One is to continue the strong down trend by breaking 1885 and continue to 1870.The second option is to take the stops at the triple bottom below and then start a 4hr retest which will take us to 1955 prices. So far, the market sentiment continues to be bearish!

Trading,How do you back test your bot?,"Helly guy, I am new here, I am studying and implement a trading bot. I have a question about how do you back test your bot? This is the basic question but I want focus on these aspects

1. How long should the back test last?

Let say you have a bot that works well when back test since 2021 until now but not good since 2019 or 2020. Is this a good bot? Will we try to build a bot and back test that bot from time T in the past until now with T as long as possible.

2. Do you fixed spread when back test?

Spread will affect price you buy or sell, then how it should be handled when back test your strategy. I should used fixed spread or not while back test my strategy.

3. Can data to back test be used between markets?

For my case, I download data gold price from Oanda and back tests my strategy using python, when I finish, I can only trade on Exness (I don't have account to trade on Oanda for some reasons). If my bot works on Oanda, can I say it will work on Exness too? Can I use Oanda data to calculate the signal for buying, selling in Exness because I only have API to download data from Oanda.

Note: I know all these questions can be answered by trying but it's better to hear from someone who already tried it.

I spent 3 years back testing it on several different exchanges and found that when I started forward testing it, my results were entirely different and not as predictable or profitable as the back tests show.

Since that lesson, I only use forward testing now but on multiple demo accounts so I can aggregate large amounts of data quickly to analyze the process.

I do backtesting on cleo.finance. There are 2 backtesting tools automated and manual. I mostly use automated. You create your bot and backtest it, there are some useful statistics and you can also replay your position history on the chart. Plus you can also include the transaction costs funding fees, commissions, and slippage."

Ive been growing my live account 10-25% a week for a few months simply doing what I‚Äôve been taught and sticking to the rules. 

I trade forex CFD through oanda. 2-5 trades a day. 50:1 leverage.

What was the starting balance of you paper account?
Did you simulate a 2k or even a 1k acct?
Your doing great!

Most traders lack an edge. I use huge datasets and a systematic approach via Python to explore edges in mew strategies.

Psychology is important but meaningless without edge.

more than 90% wont be profitable never ever in their lives.
if you want to make money in the trading world, use a different approach - e.g: give servkces/products that traders use

why do people just assume the random number of 90%\~ failure rate? In reality, if you equate failure = never making more than minimum wage from pure trading, the actual failure rate is something more like **99%.**

The problem with the failure rate is that failed trades accumulate larger losses than successfuul ones. Meaning that realizing gains is a huuge barrier.

Eiher you sell too early or you hang on to winning positions until they pull back again.  
At least this is my experience.

Having the right discipline in both directions is not as easy as it sounds."
Trading,GOLD - 2023 Price Targets,"Hello Traders,

Here is my prediction for GOLD and its target levels for 2023.

First off, I believe GOLD will be one of the best performing assets in 2023. With GOLD being a safety play during economic hardship, and the strong possibility of a recession, we should see GOLD outperform the broader market like in past recessions.

So how high will GOLD go in 2023?

GOLD will likely make new All Time Highs in 2023, potentially as early as the end of the 1st quarter. We could potentially see the price of GOLD rise as much as 20% next year.

Keep in mind we will have pullbacks along the way as price hits resistance levels on the way up, with he most significant level being the prior highs at just over $2,000. We could potentially see price initially pullback sharply off the prior highs then consolidate for weeks before breaking out.

How to trade GOLD?

You will want to enter a GOLD position on a pullback into technical support, not when experiencing FOMO after a monster move. Be patient and wait for the right setup to occur. There will be many rejections at resistance on the way up, where price will have to pullback or consolidate before the next move up. These types of scenarios present the best opportunity for a wing trade in GOLD.

Thanks Everyone

Ask your broker on what they are basing the their marging interest rates. It could be Libor for example that changes all the time.

I have trading for the past 9 months it was all good. Until they change the rollover rate within a night. So all my holding position are now paying swap fee. 

My question was is it legal firm them to change from 1.4% to -5.40%. the Fed hasn't changed the interest rate yet. What is the underlying motive ? Uk Russia war ? But how ? It looks like they just roll the dice and switch the rate trapping most traders like now being on the wrong side."

Do not think about compounding pips. 
Measure your stop loss and equate that to One percent (or 2 or 5, if you are a cowboy). That will dictate your leverage. On forex, one percent risk per trade will use approx 10 to 1 max leverage on most trades. Do the numbers.

Don't think about days on days. 

Just know, if you can do 3 percent a month, every month for five years and longer (that's 42 a year compounded monthly), you are a Bonafide star.

If you can do 6 percent a month, you are a Legend.

Exactly, and this is were you learn. The emotional aspect of paper trading is sooooo different. I know guys going back to paper several times. So the first time you go live, keep in mind you're going to loose... Eventually

It does not allow for anything else, other than ethereum though, so if you want a full list of cryptos you are better off going the route of a crypto exchange.

It‚Äôs better to trade the cash value of bitcoin, and on a bitcoin exchange like Coinbase. You can earn rewards and it‚Äôs a delight to transfer money. Keep the traditional brokers (forex.com, CMC Markets, fxview) for forex trading. And if you want to really excel, concentrate only on 1 pair.

I'm sorry but bitcoin futures are DEFINITELY a thing

Thank you for the broker suggestion! I actually made a forex demo account about a month ago and it was one of the demos that I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to trade BTC against USD. Maybe this was because it was *just* a demo account? 

If I do take the route of a crypto exchange, would you happen to know if I am still able to trade the cash value or do I have to actually purchase and trade crypto itself?

Thanks again! :)

This. Nearly all crypto exchanges have the option for futures trading. I use Binance personally. Never had any issues with them. It uses USDT though, so I guess technically you're not trading cash value.

Was it the MT4 platform account or the Web trader account? They should both have it, I personally have traded XRP/USD on my MT4 account. The demo account should have all the features of the live account

I see! So I‚Äôm just a little confused. Is what I‚Äôm trying to do here considered forex trading or futures trading?"

I'm looking at Oanda right now, and it seems the spread is 0.5. That being said, I'm not sure if that's the cheapest way to trade some derivative of the S&P500. For example, if you equate the value to /ES (S&P500 futures), you'll find that in comparison, you're paying the equivalent of 2 ticks (since the spread of /ES is pretty much .25 all the time).

Investing,"PacWest, Western Alliance Lead Regional Bank Stock Rout","From bloomberg: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-02/pacwest-western-alliance-lead-regional-bank-stock-rout

>PacWest Bancorp and Western Alliance Bancorp each slumped more than 25% Tuesday, leading a renewed selloff in regional lenders as investors continued to gauge the health of the industry after the second-largest US bank failure ever.

>Trading in shares of both banks were halted for volatility, amid the broader slide that took the KBW Regional Banking Index down as much as 6.1%, the most intraday since March 17. Comerica Inc. and Zions Bancorp. each fell more than 10%, while Charles Schwab Corp., the brokerage with a bank arm that‚Äôs come under pressure in the wake of the regional banking tumult, sank 5.3%. 

>The sector‚Äôs retreat comes a day after First Republic Bank‚Äôs seizure and sale to JPMorgan Chase & Co., and underscores investors‚Äô ongoing concerns about competitors of the four banks that have collapsed since early March. The slide has now taken the regional banking gauge down 28% this year.

>JPMorgan Chase & Co. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon was quick to proclaim the current leg of the banking crisis ‚Äúover‚Äù during a conference call discussing his bank‚Äôs acquisition of First Republic on Monday. He recommended everyone ‚Äújust take a deep breath‚Äù even as higher interest rates and stress on the commercial real estate industry pose a threat to the banking sector.

>‚ÄúWhile FRC resolution is a good sign, we haven‚Äôt had a clear solution to the lack of confidence across regional banks and may need a more holistic response from regulators or the government,‚Äù Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Herman Chan said in a message.

>Western Alliance and PacWest are among a number of regional banks investors zeroed in after Silvergate Capital Corp., SVB Financial Group and Signature Bank collapsed in quick succession and demonstrated the threat posed to commercial lenders by asset-liability mismatches and uninsured deposits.

>But both companies posted earnings results in April that appeared to appease investors, with both firms indicating their deposit bases had stabilized or recovered after initial outflows in March.

>‚ÄúIt looks like JPMorgan‚Äôs deal for FRC gave us one day of calm for the banking sector. Regional banking stocks are still looking vulnerable until we see clear signs that emergency lending programs can go away,‚Äù said Ed Moya, Oanda senior market analyst. ‚ÄúWall Street is wondering which bank could be the next one that needs a rescue and that is making it easy to pick on the other regional banks.‚Äù",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/135szpc/pacwest_western_alliance_lead_regional_bank_stock/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/135szpc/pacwest_western_alliance_lead_regional_bank_stock/,23,39,2023-05-02 16:34:03,ourpseudonym,"I'm holding all my WAL still. Their financials are doing fine, just short term market panic.

I used to work for the boutique firm that did almost all of PacWest's investment banking.  Back in the early-00s I would drive around Southern California with one of the partners jawboning with small banks, several of which PacWest ultimately acquired.  I was always skeptical of the grow-by-acquisition strategy and a few times at staff meetings I would ask, ""Do we ever go back and compare our original acquisition model assumptions with the actual results?""  Crickets ensued.  I always found that kind of amusing.  As you can imagine, we eventually parted ways.  Probably added about zero value to PacWest over the long-term... but it was fun and profitable.  Good times.

Banks are an easy pass. I don't know why investors play hot potato when stocks like these have huge trouble ahead. 

Don't do it.

So we do what? Go to cash, buy some way OTM pacw puts, hope we eventually are permitted to cash them in, and... buy some of the leftover ashes?

Exactly the same situation with Frc, just hope the media doesn‚Äôt create another panic. (They will)

Banks are an easy pass for me too. Now that I lost $30k on SVB, I can say I will never buy stock in a bank again. They are wild. 

If a company with a widget makes a mistake, like a social media fax pas or a faulty product, some portion of their market will abandon them. Sales will take a hit, they will drop prices, new buyers will enter. Over time, things will normalize. 

If a bank loses customer confidence, it is done. DONE. 
All these articles about the next bank etc are creating exactly the loss in confidence needed to kill the company.

So far, today, I've sold some PACW puts and bought another lot of their preferred shares.

FRC had negative earnings and could not liquidate to cover without breaching capital ratios.

That is not true for PACW/WAL

Frc had ~70% of its deposits as uninsured. WAL is the opposite with roughly 70% of its deposits insured. WAL has way more small customers than frc and don't need to panic if a couple big fish pull out, and there isn't any reason for the little fish to leave since they are insured.

Yeah, this is the real problem in the market now. If shorts drop the stock enough, people will panic and pull their money out, rinse and repeat.


FRC shouldn‚Äôt have failed."
Investing,Gold Has Best Week Since October on U.S. Payrolls Shock,"Gold was headed on Friday for its best week since October as a shockingly low U.S. payrolls number for last month, coupled with the yellow metal‚Äôs belated catch up to inflationary trends, put it on a course to a weekly gain of 3.5%.

Price-wise, gold was nearing peaks last seen 12 weeks ago, closing in on the $1,850 per ounce level, that could set up a return to $1,900 and ultimately the $2,000 record highs attained in August.

‚ÄúGold‚Äôs short-term momentum could make a run towards the $1,857 level, which could be followed by a move towards the $1,925 resistance level,‚Äù said Ed Moya, head of research for Americas at online trading platform OANDA.

Benchmark gold futures on New York‚Äôs Comex were up $15.45, or 0.9%, to $1,831.15 an ounce by 1:40 PM ET (17:40 GMT). The session high was $1,844.40. For the week, gold futures showed a 3.2% gain, the highest since the week ended Oct. 29.

The spot price of gold rose by $15.36, or 0.9%, to $1,830.54, after a peak at $1,843.36. For the week, spot gold printed a much higher gain of 3.5%.

Traders and fund managers sometimes decide on the direction for gold by looking at the spot price ‚Äî which reflects bullion for prompt delivery ‚Äî instead of futures.

‚ÄúGold appears poised to hit $1,850 which will be the 200-Day Simple Moving Average,‚Äù said Sunil Kumar Dixit of D.K. Dixit Charting in Kolkata, India. ‚ÄúFrom there, it could head up to $1,877, which would mark as a 50% Fibonacci retracement level of the move from the $2,075 record high to lows of $1,676.‚Äù

After months of anemic prices, gold suddenly broke out on Thursday, playing catch-up to the rally in a horde of commodities from oil to copper, and even coffee, that had reacted to inflationary pressures building since the start of the year.

Friday‚Äôs rally in gold came after the Labor Department reported that the U.S. unemployment rate rose to 6.1 percent in April as the country added a sharply lower-than-forecast 266,000 jobs in a pandemic-suppressed market.

The United States lost more than 21 million jobs between March and April 2020, at the height of business lockdowns forced by the coronavirus. More than 8 million of those jobs have not returned, officials say.

Economists had expected as many as 1 million new U.S. jobs for April, building on March's gains of 916,000. That made what the Labor Department reported disappointing to many.

‚ÄúThere's a bit of disbelief around this number,‚Äù said economist Adam Button, commenting on a post on ForexLive. ‚ÄúI wonder if this is a game-changer and shifts the conversation towards the Fed's baseline about rates staying very low for a very long time along with only-transitory inflation.‚Äù

The Federal Reserve has kept U.S. interest rates at between zero and 0.25% since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic last year, with Chairman Jerome Powell arguing that the rise in price pressures in recent months were temporary trends that would abate over time.

Analysts said while the latest U.S. jobs report itself was a damper for inflation, it nevertheless kept up the theme of monetary accommodation by the Fed, which was positive for gold.

‚ÄúGold‚Äôs best friend is Fed Chair Powell and other doves that remain committed to the idea that temporary inflation won‚Äôt persist,‚Äù said OANDA‚Äôs Moya.",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n75u6r/gold_has_best_week_since_october_on_us_payrolls/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/n75u6r/gold_has_best_week_since_october_on_us_payrolls/,24,16,2021-05-07 18:49:13,reconditedamsel7,"**Hi, welcome to /r/investing.

I prefer the title dollar has worst week vs gold.

Real rates have been declining since ~mid-March, [and gold follows](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=r87P).

Been loading up on gold. Gold shares like harmony and Goldfields going to do well coming months.

I love gooooollld. But I bought a protective put on GLD just incase.

It‚Äôs funny that you could expect the opposite effect and headlines could be written that way if gold dropped. If unemployment drops and economy runs hot, that‚Äôs a sign of inflation which should help gold.

But traders are banking on the reaction (or no reaction in this case) to the fed on interest rates rather than the inflation itself.

Yay the economy is bad so my stocks are going to do good.

Reminder that while dollar's purchasing power is at historic lows against most assets, dollar is still very strong as a currency (unless you count those dog themed e-pogs as currency) as it's still the safe haven, default reserve, and whatever quantities of cash the US printer has printed has largely been matched by the printers of all the others governments. Those that didn't print have devaluing currencies also because their countries have likely gotten absolutely wrecked to the point where their currency isn't viable.

In some cases the dollar is at historic highs against currencies like the Brazilian Real and the country is still getting wrecked."
Investing,Stock market bloodbath: Dow and Nasdaq plummet in the worst day since June,"Thursday was the Nasdaq's largest one-day decline from a record high in its history, according to Bespoke Investment Group.

All three major indexes finished the day sharply lower. The Nasdaq closed down nearly 5%, and the S&P fell 3.5%, while the Dow finished 2.8%, or 808 points, lower.

So, what happened?

For one, the Nasdaq has been outperforming the other two major stock indexes ‚Äî the Dow (INDU) and the S&P 500 (SPX) ‚Äî for months. The rally has been going on for long enough that investors are now taking profit.

Even so, the Nasdaq remains up nearly 28% in 2020, still far outpacing its counterparts. The Dow, which only recently turned positive for the year, is back in the red.

""Although there is no single driver for the weakness, it seems as if investors all of a sudden realized how overbought stocks are and sold. Someone yelled fire in a crowded theater and everyone left at once,"" said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial, in emailed comments.

But there are also technical reasons for Thursday's decline: As US-China relations sour, investors are moving money out of tech, which could get hit the hardest from a potential increase in tariffs.

""The Nasdaq is getting hit hard with the continued rotation into cyclicals and expectations big-tech will ultimately pay the cost to a further deterioration with US-Chinese relations,"" said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda.

Stocks in cyclical sectors are expected to perform better as the economy is recovering.

The Big Tech companies such as Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT), all of which are part of the Nasdaq, have become the safe-haven investment of the summer. But investors have beginning to wonder when the rally will run out of steam, either because of increased regulation or because the economy as a whole picks up enough to void the need for safety picks altogether.

what happens if sugar bottoms out? You get fucked and only walk away with the premium from the futures contract.

Your CFDs have counter party risk, they could at any moment suspend trading, widen the spreads.  Your stop loss is not guaranteed, etc....

I looked at trading wheat futures via CFD in the past (not Oanda). Everything looked like an 18% nearly guaranteed ROI. But then I realized that storage costs were to be charged by the exchange provider for long-term positions and they hid this on their platform. The 18% ROI turned into a small negative return after that. 

Generally speaking, I don‚Äôt think there would be many opportunities for guaranteed ROI like that. People who actively trade these commodities would have taken advantage of this long before it got to this point. 

I would just call Oanda and ask them how you would put up this trade.

If sugar bottoms out my long cfd position would get stopped loss at the strike price but my short futures position would be assigned, earning the difference in the strike price and initial price, along with the premium. It‚Äôs a short and long position in equal notional value so theoretically I‚Äôm completely hedged

Great point there, but I guess that‚Äôs a risk I‚Äôm willing to take for the expected return

ok yes excuse me I am mixing up derivatives here. It sounds like you would make money between the strike price of the CFD and the spot price of the commodity today of $10, that is an interesting situation. You may have found an arbitrage opportunity I wonder if there is any nuance to the CFD, is there a transaction cost for enterring in that?

Only transaction cost would be the bidask spread which is pennies compared to the notional value. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if I found an arbitrage situation but with a 20% riskless yield, sounds too good to be true."

Forex, especially with the amount of leverage the brokers allow, is a very VERY dangerous gamble for a novice to make.  Use their demo mode for a long time to prove you actually know what you are doing before putting any real money to use.  When you do put real money to work, it had better be money you can afford to lose.

IMO unless you are a full time pro then currency trading on the short term with these huge amounts of leverage is basically gambling.

OAuth is awesome for small shops doing algo investing because it is language-agnostic. Will link the original article upon request.

Why is an authentication API or relevant for investing/trading?

[tradier](https://developer.tradier.com/documentation) is my fave

Please link, thanks

It enables algo traders to use their language of choice instead of being tied to an SDK/language combination. My hope is that this will pick up pace and bring a lot of R and Python devs into algo trading.

Got it. See top comment."
Investing,Does ThinkOrSwim have a positioning calculator at the order screen like OANDA? I can't find it.,"This is an example of what I mean: http://imgur.com/a/ovM9C

I'm a forex trader, but I want to have the option to trade other asset classes so I am looking at TDA. When placing a trade on OANDA, it tells you the dollar amount of the take profit and stop loss, this makes it very easy to calculate how I need to size a position to risk the appropriate amount per trade. I'm trying to re-familiarize myself with the platform, but not having the position sizing calculator is kind of disappointing. It would mean that I'd have to slow down to do the math before entering each position, and since the market is always moving that math would never be exactly right, at least for entering at market, which I usually do.

Is there any way to remedy this?",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6ouu64/does_thinkorswim_have_a_positioning_calculator_at/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/6ouu64/does_thinkorswim_have_a_positioning_calculator_at/,31,2,2017-07-22 12:55:31,GlobalMacroGang,"You can call the ToS team, they are REALLY good

Investing,Regulation T Question,"I got on board the nugt train rather late today at 61.85. I realized after an hour it wouldn't go much higher so I tried to set a limit sell for 62.50 but I was greeted by this message: ""You are attempting to sell a security that was purchased all or in part with unsettled funds that have yet to settle. If you place this order, your account may be in violation of regulation T and could be restricted for a period of 90 days. To proceed with this order, please contact us at 1-877-495-5464. (via TradeKing)"" I kind of understand what they're saying (using unsettled funds) and here is a pic of my recent trades (http://imgur.com/Nyiu4qy). There must be a way around this though right? Would Oanda be much better for higher trading frequency? Or is it just that the lower minimum deposit brokerages don't allow day trading ? thanks for any helpful answers",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/47hc08/regulation_t_question/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/47hc08/regulation_t_question/,3,9,2016-02-25 04:59:14,daemonika,"Reg T says you can't sell a security you haven't paid for yet with settled funds. Attempting to do so is a free riding violation. There is no way around it in a cash account and it isn't a broker rule it is a federal regulation. You must either wait for your previous sales to settle or deposit more funds. If you commit enough free riding violations (3 I think), your account will be restricted to purchasing securities with settled funds only. 

Alternatively you could use a margin account instead of a cash account (this Reg T rule doesn't apply to margin accounts), but then you need to be aware of the Pattern Day Trading rule that do apply to margin accounts.

[deleted]

That's not limited margin. Still a cash account. It would be an unsettled trade liquidation. Wait till gdx settles and you are good

I'm confused lol. The money I'm using is from my bank account idk how I could be using money I don't have...also is gdx a special kind of stock ? Like if it was apple could i buy and sell x2 without this reg T thing?

After you purchase something in a cash account it takes three business days to be settled. It has nothing to do with whether or not you had the money in your account or not. It's the funds changing hands. As mentioned previously if you liquidate your position you will be free riding and subject to the penalties that entails.

The way to avoid this is to have a margin account. However you can not make a round trip in one business day with an account balance of less than 25k (well, you can make 3 in a rolling 5 day period, but more than that and you're out for 90 days). If you have more than 25k you trade as much as you like in a day.

ohhhh that makes sense thanks a lot

I'd recommend you upgrade to a margin account for this reason.  If something starts going against you, you want to be able to get out without jumping through hoops.

Yep...I'm stuck in nugt which is pretty volatile until monday"
Investing,Top ten outrageous predictions for Saxo Bank in 2015,"Top ten outrageous predictions for Saxo Bank in 2015

1.	Saxo Bank dishonor CHF trades on January 15, 2015, after the SNB decision to remove the EURCHF floor. And yet no clients complain about it.

2.	Saxo Bank make up a price of EURCHF and other cross-CHF exchange rates with reference to EBS prices, replacing the prices it quoted to clients as a market maker, 12 hours after completion of transactions.

3.	Saxo Bank is convinced that tradable prices quoted on their trading platform were quoted by someone else instead of Saxo Bank itself.

4.	Saxo Bank believes that no one is curious on how Saxo Bank hedge against clients‚Äô short CHF positions.

5.	Saxo Bank spend less than 1 minute to figure out how much they lose on their own CHF positions (cause it‚Äôs right on their screens), but they needed 12 hours to figure out how to allocate the losses to clients.

6.	On the second day of the Swiss Franc appreciation, Saxo Bank tell people that more clients joined them, despite they dishonor trades, manipulate trade records, detain clients‚Äô assets and go after clients‚Äô on the alleged debt that Saxo Bank booked to them.

7.	Saxo Bank believes that international clients will not sue them in Denmark due to the language barrier.

8.	Saxo Bank believes that they can pocket this windfall gain from clients‚Äô assets and next year they can go to IPO.

9.	Saxo Bank still cannot understand why some brokers such as Oanda forgive retail clients‚Äô negative balances ‚Äì though these brokers dare not to manipulate trade records.

10.	Danish FSA and regulators around the world decide to forgive Saxo Bank. Saxo Bank continues to write outrageous predictions for 2016.

Investing,"So, here's the plan.","I'm 25 years old and debt free. 

I'm in the military. I don't make a lot, but I live well within my means and can rely on Uncle Sam for my health and dental, so that's a good plus. It also allows me to be a USAA member, and I plan on using them for my trading. I already do my banking and insurance through them as well. 

I already have $30k in a mutual fund through Franklin-Templeton that's doing fairly well, that's been running since last year. Not taking any out of that until I'm in my 50s unless it's a matter of homelessness. 

I have about $40k just sitting around doing nothing. The plan is to keep half of that as my emergency fund (on top of another $10k emergency fund that I pretend doesn't exist) and put the rest of it to work. 

I'm looking at a decent portfolio and plan on dividing that $20k up pretty evenly among these:

Cisco (CSCO): 13.1 P/E, near the low end of their 52wk range and 3.4% yield. Plus they're a little safer due to gov't contracts out the wazoo. Yespls.

Microsoft (MSFT): 14.2 P/E, 2.8% yield,  but close to the highest share price they've seen all year. Still considering it based on XB1 and windows phone starting to pick up steam in their respective markets, plus with Windows 9 coming soonish should be a good deal. 

Intel (INTC): 13.8 P/E, 3.5% yield, mid - high based on ttm. Upcoming 6 physical core chips have got me fairly excited for both the hardware and this stock.

ConocoPhillips (COP): 13.7 P/E, 3.9% yield. Can you *really* go wrong with oil, especially starting into the summer months? 

General Electric (GE): 15.6 P/E, 3.4% yield. Pretty rock solid energy sector stock.

Johnson & Johnson (JNJ): 17.8 P/E, 2.7% yield. Another solid company. They've got their fingers in so many different products it's basically just market trend. 

Facebook (FB): Outrageous P/E, no yield. I'm going to wait until their price slide levels off and buy in for about half as much as I'm putting into the others. Their next announcement is 1 May. If it's looking good, I'll double up. If not, I'll hang on to what I've got until Oculus releases a consumer version of their headset. I've had their first dev kit for a while now and that's enough to make me a believer, Oculus is going to be huge. 

...aaand I might piss around with a couple thousand in Forex for funsies. Had a demo account with Oanda a little while back and doubled my monopoly money over 2 months. If I can do well with it in another demo, I'm going in for reals.

I've pretty much already made up my mind that I'm okay with this money not even existing. It's not like I need it to live comfortably and I've got plenty of backup funds. I guess what I'm looking for is a sanity check on this, like maybe you could point out something absolutely mental that I might have missed. Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/21s0l7/so_heres_the_plan/,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/21s0l7/so_heres_the_plan/,0,16,2014-03-30 21:57:59,jimmysaint13,"Take all your money out of that mutual fund, you're getting destroyed with fees.

The first thing you should do is max your TSA. The TSA is the best investment vehicle available.

After that you should open a Roth IRA, I suggest with Vanguard. Put your money into index funds or a target retirement fund.

Stay the hell away from Forex. It's a zero-sum game, and with commissions it's actually a slightly negative-sum game. You'd be just as well off taking your money into a casino.

Low cost index funds are your best bet. 

I don't think your portfolio would have enough diversification. Too much tech, too much energy. Also, stay away from forex. 

If I were you I would become very comfortable with reading the reports that companies file with the SEC. You should know all about 10K, 10Q, 8K, forms 3, 4, 5, and Proxy Filings.

It is best to get your information directly from the companies themselves, not from analysts or other people's opinions. You are in charge of your investment portfolio and you need to be able to justify any transactions you make.

Also, I strongly suggest reading ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham. It has excellent reviews and is regarded as one of (if not the) best books on investing ever written. It will tell you, among other things, that following the herd is very likely going to get you burned.

I agree that you should stay away from Forex too, as you are solely dependent on the monetary policy of foreign governments, which can print money and do other things to make the value of their currency especially unpredictable. 

CSCO has been a dud for the last year or so, consider writing cover calls to increase gains. INTL, I would avoid, also a feast or famine stock. I also think Oculus is will be virtually non-material to FB for the forseeable future. 

You could consider some ETFs with lower fees for diversity (maybe XLE, XLF, etc.) , Forex is for the most part a shit-storm. 

If you're willing to do some research, I'd even say that it may not be a terrible idea to use 10-20% of your intended portfolio on speculative plays (well researched, educated investments). It'd be better than going to a casino.

Why are you picking individual companies with a heavy leaning towards energy and tech?  Is there something wrong with ETFs such as SPY?

Have you actually done any research on these companies?  Are their earnings increasing or stable?  What is their debt/asset ratio?  Do you know anything about the actual business side of these companies or are you simply picking companies whose names you know of?

I have to agree with one of the comments below... as a 25 year old, 75% of your portfolio should be in stocks. Sounds like your current worth it about $90K, so something like $67.5K should be going into stocks, rather than a mutual fund.

You're young and you can afford the risk. 

As for one of the comments below hounding at you for picking ""name-brand"" stocks... there's nothing wrong with picking blue-chip stocks, but I might substitute Facebook for Tesla, but that's just me :)

Edit: Wanted to return to say that an emergency fund should be approximately equal to 6 months of living. Consider things like insurance (car, home, auto, health, etc.), bills (utilities, phone bill, etc), food, gas, mortgage, etc. Take that amount, and subtract it from the total amount you have available to invest. Then 75% of that should be in stocks if you want to be on par to retire on time.

What do you think another good sector would be? I do realize I'm a bit tech - heavy, but that's the field I'm already in, I work IT for the Air Force. Paraphrasing Peter Lynch, you should invest in companies you already know, the quickest way to lose is to get into a company in a field you know nothing about. 

I've thought about Activision-Blizzard, but it just doesn't seem like a good time to buy in with them right now. WoW is their biggest cash cow and has been in slow, steady decline for a while now. They also recently released a new expansion for Diablo 3 that was well received, but that was a few weeks ago and I feel like the benefits have already been reaped on that. With no other prospective releases on the horizon, I'm hesitant. 

I've been looking at Philip - Morris, too. Nothing creates reliable revenue like addiction. 

So what do you think? Maybe drop GE and Intel in favor of entertainment and cigarettes? 

You know that mutual funds can hold stocks, right...? "

It‚Äôll work until it doesn‚Äôt. Gold is highly based on macroeconomic elements, and if there‚Äôs a change, your strategy can go bottoms up easy

There are other factors cause the price rise, and I think most people will not like what I am about to say. 

The price of gold is rising versus the US dollar because the value of the dollar is weakening against most currencies of modern economies. Like it or not, the US National debt of $33 trillion dollars is undermining the value of the dollar. 

The only major currency that I can think of that is weakening versus the dollar is the Japanese yen, which I am loving. I arrived in Japan on Wednesday to look for a home to buy. The dollar is currently at a 34 year high against the yen.

a) It was totally wrong.  
b) Despite falling recently we are WAY off that.

Same pattern as earlier this year.  Watch for 3800 support and buy in.  3600 would only occur in a short window if Puntang and Netanyahoo don‚Äôt lay off the weapons.

It takes a 2-3 years before we realize how bad shit is. We are almost at that point. It's going to fall off.

How do I make this make sense as someone whose never traded SPX but trades SPY daily? You divide SPX by 10 right?

Does that mean 3600 at the end of the year? If so that‚Äôs still a couple months away.

I dont think it was wrong, delayed maybe.

Yes‚Ä¶ true. Still 2 months in the year. But it would be a much more significant decrease from this point.

About a 13% drop."

StockMarket,Tesla shares rebound from January bottom," 

[Shares of Tesla](https://www.foxbusiness.com/search?q=tesla&ss=fb) cleared $200 on Thursday as the stock continues to obliterate losses from the past year.

In 2023, shareholders for the automotive, [artificial intelligence](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/artificial-intelligence), and clean energy company watched the stock price nearly double after hitting a 52-week low of $101.81, on Jan. 6.

In an interview with FOX Business, Edward Moya, a senior market analyst for OANDA in New York said, ""Wall Street still has its doubts about growth but is very optimistic that the worst is over for some of the more beaten-up tech stocks.""

""Tesla's rally can't be stopped right now as investors remain upbeat about growth in the EV space and on the global¬†economic¬†outlook for Europe and China,"" he added.

 Since hitting its low point last month, Tesla stock has rallied nearly 90% through Wednesday.

Currently, the stock has been up eight consecutive days; up 26.99% over this period to notch the longest winning streak since July 22, 2022, when it rose for eight straight trading days.

Also on Thursday, Tesla is the most active stock in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 and is the second-best performer in the tech-heavy index, as tracked by the Dow Jones Market Data Group.

The last time Tesla stock closed above $200 was Nov. 4, while the last time shares reached $200 was on Nov. 15.

 Tesla's most [recent earnings report](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/tesla-posts-q4-financial-results-ceo-elon-musk-earnings-call) and changes in the federal government's electric vehicle tax credit are helping shares.

Elon Musk's company said it generated about $24.32 billion in [fourth-quarter revenue](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/earnings), marking a 37% increase from the same three-month period last year. The company‚Äôs profits saw a roughly 59% jump from 2021‚Äôs Q4 to $3.7 billion, while its earnings per share came in at $1.19.

Refinitiv estimates for revenue and EPS were $24.16 billion and $1.13 respectively, meaning [Tesla](https://www.foxbusiness.com/category/tesla) came in higher on both.

In January, Tesla slashed the price of its baseline Model Y Long Range to $53,490 and Model Y Performance to $56,990.

[**GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE**](https://www.foxbusiness.com/apps-products)

*****
> Stock futures traded higher Wednesday as Wall Street tries to recover its footing after a tough first session of the year.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 55 points, or 0.17%. S&P 500 and Nasdaq-100 futures climbed 0.23% and 0.44%, respectively.
*****
> Sentiment was boosted in part by encouraging inflation data from Europe, including a greater-than-expected decline in the French consumer price index and a drop in German import prices.
*****
> U.S. stocks started 2023 on a downbeat note Tuesday as rising rate concerns, high inflation and recessionary fears crushed hopes that Wall Street could kick off the new year on a positive note. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite lost 0.4% and 0.8%, respectively, while the Dow closed just below breakeven. The major indexes were also pressured by steep declines in Apple and Tesla shares.
*****
> ‚ÄúU.S. stocks were unable to hold onto earlier gains as restrictive policy and recession fears remained front and center for investors,‚Äù wrote Oanda‚Äôs senior market analyst Ed Moya in a note to clients Tuesday. ‚ÄúDiscount buying triggered another bear market rebound that didn‚Äôt last long at all.‚Äù
*****
> Investors will gain more insight into what Fed members are thinking on Wednesday afternoon as minutes from the central bank‚Äôs latest policy meeting are released. Earlier in the day, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, and ISM manufacturing data are due out.
*****
> Friday‚Äôs December jobs report also will be closely watched as it is the last read on the labor market before the Fed meeting in February.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt is too early to start betting on a Fed pivot this year and that should make this difficult environment for stocks,‚Äù Moya said.

StockMarket,CarMax‚Äôs Huge Earnings Miss Sends Warning Signal on US Consumer - Another Troubling Data Point to Weakening Consumer Sentiment,"*  Auto dealers Carvana, Sonic Automotive plunge in broad selloff
* Rising rates, low confidence makes consumers wary of spending

**CarMax‚Äôs fiscal second-quarter numbers failed to meet Wall Street‚Äôs expectations on nearly every metric**. **The** **company said** **the ability of potential buyers to afford vehicles has become a challenge, with rising interest rates and low consumer confidence adding further wrinkles.**

‚Äú**CarMax has reminded Wall Street that parts of the economy are already in a recession**,‚Äù said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda Corp. The ‚Äúaffordability challenges‚Äù highlighted by the company as the main reason for the big miss suggests it is ‚Äúonly going to get worse as Fed tightening starts to impact the economy,‚Äù Moya added.

‚ÄúWhen you combine these results with the story from yesterday that demand for iPhones is weak, it raises the question about the consumer as we move toward the holiday selling season,‚Äù said Matt Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak + Co. **‚ÄúIf the consumer is weak, you can take a soft landing off the table.‚Äù**  

""**The story of CarMax‚Äôs second-quarter is clear: demand destruction,‚Äù** said Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas. ‚ÄúHigh used car prices and rising rates are causing a buyers‚Äô strike.‚Äù

CarMax has No Moat.

CarMax overbids at wholesale auctions - and then attempts to pass their excess cost onto the consumer.

CarMax is an attempt to create a High End Used Car.

Lol. There is NO such Market! 

If people can afford CarMax -they can afford a NEW car. 

That's the bottom line. Every time. No moat.

Hard landing is also off the table

Carvana is a joke.  

Looking at a RAV4 and I can get a new one from Toyota cheaper than what Carvana wants for  for a 2 year old RAV4 with 30k miles.

The whole point of rising rates is to decrease consumer demand. A soft landing is really just multiple hard landings cancelling each other out. 

Hot take: this is a good sign that demand is finally cooling off.

This is not the consumer s problem, but the greedy used car dealers problems. Like other comments said some used cars are more expensive than new.

I find my used cars in the same place I find my strippers and blow: Craigslist

Plop landing incoming

The problem with this logic is that you are assuming you can get a new toyota rav4, a popular model, in a short time and at msrp easily, which not gonna happen

When new cars are actually available and and prices coming down, used car prices will come down substantially more

I remember toyota said awhile back that their dealership inventory has 36h availability on average , not measured by days or weeks, hours

Polar Bear Plunge.  Why not, winter is coming.

I could order one today and have it 2-3 weeks.  The are selling cars that are in transit to the dealership.  My lease which has about $6k in positive equity is up in December."

> Following the rate hike from the Fed, DoubleLine Capital‚Äôs CEO Jeffrey Gundlach told CNBC‚Äôs ‚ÄúClosing Bell Overtime‚Äù he believes the central bank is no longer behind the curve on inflation and Powell has regained credibility.
*****
> ‚ÄúThis market reaction seems less of a sugar high than the prior two in June and May,‚Äù Gundlach said.
*****
> The Dow jumped more than 400 points in the previous session, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite added 2.6% and 4.06%, respectively.
*****
> All S&P 500 sectors ended the day higher, with communications services posting its best daily performance since April 2020.
*****
> ‚ÄúFor the most part, what‚Äôs really driving this move is that the economy is still performing okay and it looks like the Fed is probably going to slow the pace of tightening down by the next policy meeting,‚Äù said Ed Moya, Oanda‚Äôs senior market analyst.
*****
> Investors have grown increasingly concerned in recent months that the central bank‚Äôs attempts to tame surging prices would move the economy closer to a recession, if it hasn‚Äôt already entered one.
*****
> Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said during a press conference he does not believe the economy has entered a recession.
*****
> ‚ÄúI do not think the U.S. is currently in a recession and the reason is there are too many areas of the economy that are performing too well,‚Äù he said.
*****
> Investors looking for further clues into the state of the economy are awaiting a reading on second-quarter GDP slated for Thursday. While two back-to-back negative quarters of growth is viewed by many as a recession, the official definition is more nuanced, taking into account additional factors, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.
*****
> Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the economy to have barely expanded last quarter after contracting 1.6% in the first.

# [Stock futures dip slightly as market attempts to build on Monday‚Äôs comeback](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/25/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures fell slightly on Tuesday a day after a big reversal in markets gave some traders hope the April sell-off was nearing an end.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average eased about 140 points, or 0.4%. S&P 500 futures were down about 0.4%. Nasdaq 100 futures fell 0.4%.
*****
> On Monday, the Dow advanced more than 200 points, after cutting a near 500-point loss from earlier in the day. The dramatic market reversal pushed the Nasdaq Composite higher by 1.3% and the S&P 500 up by 0.6%.
*****
> ‚ÄúQuite an impressive reversal, unfortunately we don‚Äôt believe that [Monday‚Äôs] low is the end of the market‚Äôs drawdown,‚Äù wrote Rob Ginsberg, technical analyst with Wolfe Research. ‚ÄúThe sell-off still feels a bit too orderly to us.‚Äù
*****
> The bounce was welcomed by investors after stocks ended the previous week on a sour note, with the Dow falling to its fourth losing week in a row and the S&P and Nasdaq hitting three-week losing streaks Friday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq fell into bear market territory last week, but after Monday‚Äôs comeback sits 19.8% from its record. For April, the S&P 500 is off by 5% and the Nasdaq is down more than 8%.
*****
> Monday‚Äôs reversal was led by names like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which rallied in the afternoon amid falling interest rates and ahead of an intense week of earnings for mega cap tech stocks. Twitter also jumped after its board accepted Tesla CEO Elon Musk‚Äôs offer to take it private.
*****
> Alphabet and Microsoft were slightly higher in premarket trading Tuesday before their quarterly reports after the bell. Meta, Amazon and Apple will report later in the week.
*****
> UPS shares added more than 1% in premarket trading after the shipper‚Äôs quarterly earnings and revenue topped expectations. The company also reaffirmed its guidance. 3M shares were marginally higher in premarket trading after first-quarter results topped expectations.
*****
> ‚ÄúA third of the S&P is reporting [earnings] this week, and you‚Äôre probably going to see much of the same: lots of top- and bottom-line beats. Companies are going to talk about margin pressures and passing on price increases to the consumer, but they‚Äôre still going to highlight there‚Äôs still overall optimism about the economy,‚Äù Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, told CNBC.
*****
> Between the continuation of strong earnings and a quiet period from the Federal Reserve, there will likely be a relief rally in the market, Moya added.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not going to be getting more nervousness about Fed tightening, because we won‚Äôt be hearing much more about it until the May meeting,‚Äù he said.
*****
> In economic data, investors are expecting fresh numbers for new home sales and consumer confidence Tuesday morning.

*****

# [Stock futures are flat as a big week of economic data kicks off](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/27/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)
*****
> Stock futures were steady Monday morning as a week filled with key economic reports kicked off, and investors continue to keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve‚Äôs planned interest rate hikes.
*****
> Futures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 3 points, while S&P 500 futures rose 0.1%. Nasdaq 100 futures added 0.1%.
*****
> Shares of Tesla popped more than 5% in premarket trading on Monday on news it wants to split its stock so it can pay a stock dividend to shareholders.
*****
> The Securities and Exchange Commission filing said Tesla will ask at its annual shareholders meeting ‚Äúfor an increase in the number of authorized shares of common stock ... in order to enable a stock split of the Company‚Äôs common stock in the form of a stock dividend.‚Äù
*****
> Elsewhere on Monday, parts of The Treasury yield curve inverted on Monday, raising some recession concerns. Earlier on Monday, the yield on the 5-year Treasury note rose to 2.6361%, while the 30-year yield was down less than 1 basis point to 2.6004%.
*****
> However, the main yield spread that traders watch ‚Äî the spread between the 2-year and the 10-year rate ‚Äî remained positive for now.
*****
> The Dow and S&P 500 rose on Friday to close out their second consecutive winning week. The Dow gained 153 points, or 0.4%. The S&P 500 advanced 0.5% and has more than erased its losses since Russia invaded Ukraine in late February. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite dipped 0.2% but still finished the week in the green.
*****
> The moves came as investors continue to monitor developments in Russia‚Äôs war on Ukraine and expectations about the Fed‚Äôs plans to hike interest rates.
*****
> ‚ÄúIt seems the skyrocketing move higher with commodity prices has taken a break and that has allowed investors a chance to pile back into equities,‚Äù said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. ‚ÄúGeopolitical risks remain very elevated and the rally in equities over the past two weeks is impressive. The U.S. economy is still in good shape, but buying every stock market dip probably won‚Äôt be the attitude for most traders going forward given how hawkish the Fed has turned.‚Äù
*****
> Investors continue to keep a close eye on the Fed. Wall Street firms from Goldman Sachs to Bank of America penciled in half-point hikes in future Fed meetings this year after the central bank‚Äôs chair Jerome Powell vowed to be tough on inflation and said rate increases could become more aggressive if necessary.
*****
> On Friday, the benchmark 10-year yield touched a fresh multi-year high of 2.5% as investors priced in a more aggressive rate hike cycle, which helped lift financial stocks while tech stocks pulled back.
*****
> Investors are looking forward to the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS, this week. The JOLTS report is one set of employment data that the Federal Reserve is watching closely as it tightens monetary policy. ADP will also release its private payrolls data ahead of the main show, the closely watched monthly jobs report, on Friday.
*****
> Monday is a light day for earnings reports but several big companies are scheduled to report their quarterly results this week, including BioNTech, Micron and Walgreens Boots Alliance.

StockMarket,Can a broker( Oanda) change their rollover fee or financing fee from positive to negative overnight without warning?,"  

Hi, 

I am with Oanda as my broker. I trade mostly positive swap pairs or bonds.

I have a few long positions in us t bond @ 1.40% for a few months 

On the 22 Feb 2022, the long position rate was 1.40% which means I receive a few dollars per day because I am long. 

Suddenly on 23 Feb 2022, the long position has changed to -5.40% now I paying instead of earning. 

My understanding is they would decrease but gradually but not from 1.40% to -5.40% overnight. that's a 6% decrease in one night. They didn't send emails or make any announcements. 

At this is point it's more gambling than trading since the dealer would change the rules based on their good-willing. 

The Fed hasn't changed its rate yet how did Oanda just decide to change its rate like that ? 

This is like a no-brainer game for the broker to take to the other side of the trade since they change their rate so drastically most traders on their platform will be forced to pay a hefty daily fee or close their positions to avoid daily negative fees market will tank. 

How could the broker decrease a 6% in one night without any announcement? IS this even legal? If they are allowed it means they can manipulate the market at their will. All it takes it's to play with the daily rollover fee over and over. Even a kid would make money if he's the dealer. 

I understand there would be a gradual increase or decrease in rollover fee but I never saw 6% just like that from 1.4% to -5.4% ( long). 

Fed still hasn't changed their rate on US T-Bond what else could affect? 

I am in Canada. I would think to contact IIroc but I would like to have some feedback here. 

Something tells me this is misconduct.",https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t1l7fb/can_a_broker_oanda_change_their_rollover_fee_or/,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/t1l7fb/can_a_broker_oanda_change_their_rollover_fee_or/,0,1,2022-02-26 02:11:17,MagicFlyingBird,Umm something pretty close to ww3 started so stuff can and will change fast

*****
> The comments came after the Russian government said earlier Tuesdayin the day that some troops who had been on the Ukrainian border had returned to their bases.

*****
> ‚ÄúThe latest inflation data continue to decimate the ‚Äòinflation is purely transitory‚Äô theory,‚Äô‚Äù said Michael Cembalest, chairman of market and investment strategy at J.P. Morgan Asset Management.
*****
> ‚ÄúAfter pricing in less than one Fed hike as of last September, markets and Fed watchers now expect between 6 and 7 hikes over the next year, with some arguing for a 50 basis point move and not just 25,‚Äù Cembalest added.

> The move comes a day ahead of important inflation news as the Labor Department on Friday releases the consumer price index for November. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expect the year-over-year growth rate to be 6.7%. If that is the case, it will mark the biggest move since June 1982.
*****
> Federal Reserve officials are expected to react to the burst in inflation by announcing next week that it will begin pulling back on its economic aid.
*****
> The first step will be accelerating the reduction in the central bank‚Äôs monthly bond purchases, with markets expecting the Fed to double the taper to $30 billion. That in turn could pave the way for interest rate hikes as soon as the spring of 2022 and mark the latest Fed policy pivot under Chairman Jerome Powell.
*****
> Weekly jobless claims data will be released on Thursday at 8:30 a.m. on Wall Street. Economists are expecting the number of first-time-filers to come in at 211,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
> During regular trading Wednesday, the Dow and S&P 500 advanced 0.1% and 0.3%, respectively, with each registering a third straight day of gains. The S&P‚Äôs gain over the last three days is the strongest of the year, according to MKM Partners.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.64%, also registering a third day of gains. Apple had the most positive impact on the index, while Nvidia was the biggest drag.
*****
> Equities got a boost after Pfizer and BioNTech said Wednesday morning that a booster dose of their vaccine provides a high level of protection against the new omicron variant.
*****
> ‚ÄúThe range of possibilities is still wide, but in the bigger picture, we think the odds are still very much in favor of the pandemic phase winding down,‚Äù Bank of America wrote in a note to clients following the announcement. ‚ÄúIn our view, COVID is here to stay, but a shift to the endemic phase is approaching where infections are common but severe outcomes / lockdowns / travel restrictions are not,‚Äù the firm added.
*****
> With Wednesday‚Äôs gain, the S&P 500 is now just 0.9% below its all-time intraday high from Nov. 22.
*****
> Ed Moya, senior market analyst with Oanda, said that the market is in a wait-and-see mode ahead of Friday‚Äôs inflation report, which could ‚Äúfuel further Fed rate hike bets.‚Äù Economists are expecting the report to show that prices rose 0.7% in November month-over-month, according to estimates from Dow Jones.
*****
> ‚ÄúWhile growth and labor markets have provided reasons to be optimistic about the economy, inflation is also running hot and sits at a 30-year high,‚Äù UBS wrote in a recent note to clients. ‚ÄúWith the omicron variant entering the picture, investors are now questioning what monetary policy will look like going forward. The pandemic has already greatly increased the uncertainty over the economic outlook,‚Äù the firm added, noting that its base case is that the Fed will be patient.
*****
> There are some notable earnings reports on Thursday, including from Oracle, Broadcom and Lululemon, all of which report after the market closes.

# [Dow futures rise 100 points as travel stocks get boost following omicron sell-off](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/01/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Dow futures rose in early trading Thursday despite the arrival of the latest Covid variant on U.S. shores and as the White House tightened travel restrictions.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 120 points. S&P 500 futures were flat and Nasdaq 100 futures dipped 0.4%.
*****
> The Biden administration reacted to the news that an omicron case had been reported in California by asking businesses to proceed with vaccination requirements, even though the administration‚Äôs mandate was halted in courts pending review. The White House also tightened travel rules, requiring inbound passengers to be tested within 24 hours prior to departure.
*****
> Airline, casino and energy stocks led the gainers in premarket trading.
*****
> Dow component Boeing‚Äôs shares jumped 3.6%, cruise line Royal Caribbean was up 3.6% while MGM Resorts International moved 2.7% higher, with Covid-sensitive companies benefitting amid early evidence showing the new strain may be less severe than earlier versions.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe remain cautious on S&P 500 amid a hawkish Fed tightening into an overvalued market,‚Äù said Savita Subramanian, Bank of America Securities head of U.S. equity & quantitative strategy.
*****
> Still, Bank of America noted that December has historically been the strongest month for the S&P 500, with the average gaining 2.3% on average since 1936 and positive 79% of the time. However, December has not always been immune to sell-offs, Subramanian added.
*****
> ‚ÄúAnother risk is an inflation-led consumption hit, especially as fiscal/monetary stimulus run out. Fed Chair Powell‚Äôs comments on accelerated tapering and retiring the word ‚Äòtransitory‚Äô indicate that the Fed‚Äôs focus is now inflation rather than employment.
*****
> During regular trading on Wednesday, stocks posted strong gains earlier in the session, but fell on news that the first omicron case had been reported in California. The Dow fell about 460 points, after the 30-stock benchmark had advanced 521 points. The S&P dipped 1.18%, giving back an earlier gain of about 1.9%. The Nasdaq Composite slid 1.83%, after earlier trading 1.8% higher.
*****
> ‚ÄúInvestors are increasingly cautious about the Omicron variant as well as the likelihood of faster tapering,‚Äù TD Securities said in a note to clients.
*****
> Wednesday‚Äôs whipsaw continues a highly volatile streak for stocks as the market digests what the new variant means.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen this movie before and Wall Street will likely remain COVID-variant headline driven until a clear assessment over this wave can be made,‚Äù said Ed Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda. ‚ÄúThe next couple of weeks will likely see risk appetite take a cue from incremental Omicron updates, supply chain issues, and every inflation reading,‚Äù he added.
*****
> On the data front, weekly initial jobless claims numbers will be released Thursday at 8:30 a.m. ET. Economists are expecting a print of 240,000, according to estimates from Dow Jones. The prior reading showed 199,000 first-time filers, which was the lowest since November 1969. The November jobs report will be released on Friday.
*****
> Thursday‚Äôs reading follows a better-than-expected ADP report on Wednesday. Private payrolls increased by 534,000 in November, ahead of the expected 506,000.

# [Stock futures are little changed after Lowe‚Äôs and Target post earnings beats](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/16/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> Stock futures were little changed in morning trading Wednesday as investors weighed earnings reports from big-box retailers Target and Lowe‚Äôs.
*****
> Futures on the Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped by 14 points. S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were little changed.
*****
> Home improvement giant Lowe‚Äôs got a boost after reporting earnings that easily beat Wall Street expectations. The stock initially popped in premarket trading as the company not only topped the Street view but also raised its full-year sales forecast. Shares were last higher by less than 1%.
*****
> Target posted beats on the top and bottom lines, however, its CEO noted rising costs related to supply chain issues and compensation could have an impact going forward as the company plans to absorb those costs rather than passing them onto the customer. Shares slid 3.3% premarket.
*****
> Shares of Dow component Boeing rose nearly 2% in premarket trading after the company received an Akasa Air order for its 737 MAX worth $9 billion. The aerospace company‚Äôs stock has been a laggard this year, up just 5.5%.
*****
> Also, Tesla moved higher by about 1% as the stock continues its rebound after founder and CEO Elon Musk sold a chunk of his shares.
*****
> On the downside, Visa shares slumped about 2% after Amazon said it will stop accepting payments made via Visa credit cards issued in the U.K. starting next year.
*****
> The moves in futures trading come after fresh economic data and corporate earnings signaled U.S. consumers are ramping up spending despite rising prices.
*****
> The Dow added 54.77 points, or 0.15%. The S&P 500 gained 0.39% and the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.76%.
*****
> Retail sales rose 1.7% in October, the Commerce Department reported Tuesday, faster than economists expected. The figure measures how much consumers spend on goods across a number of categories.
*****
> Strong quarterly results from Home Depot also boosted investor sentiment Tuesday. The home improvement retailer led gainers on the Dow after earnings topped analyst estimates. Walmart also reported better-than-expected results, though its shares declined.
*****
> ‚ÄúUS stocks rallied after an impressive retail sales report, solid industrial production data, and retail earnings showed the consumer is handling the current pricing increases. All signs are pointing to a very strong holiday season for retailers and that should help keep sending stocks higher,‚Äù Edward Moya, senior market analyst at Oanda, said in a Tuesday note.
*****
> Investors await more retail earnings Wednesday from TJX, Bath & Body Works and Victoria‚Äôs Secret. Other major companies reporting results Wednesday include Cisco Systems and Nvidia.

*****
> The central bank said it will begin to slow its bond-buying program, signaling that the economy can now handle an unwinding of pandemic stimulus.

*****
> ‚Ä≥[W]e‚Äôre coming off a very strong quarter of earnings, which has taken priority over downside risk fears that had weighed in the run-up to the reporting season,‚Äù said Oanda‚Äôs Craig Erlam. ‚ÄúThe economy will have to continue showing signs of significant improvement to keep investors on board as they adjust to a world without central banks keeping rates at extremely low levels,‚Äù he added.
*****
> On Thursday weekly jobless numbers will be released, with economists forecasting 275,000 first-time claims, according to estimates from Dow Jones. Last week‚Äôs number came in at a 281,000, the lowest since the pandemic began.

# [Dow futures edge higher a day after hitting another record](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/stock-market-futures-open-to-close-news.html)

*****
> U.S. stock index futures nudged higher during early morning trading on Wednesday after the Dow and S&P closed at record highs as earnings season continues.
*****
> Futures contracts tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 33 points. S&P 500 futures were off flat while Nasdaq 100 futures dropped 20 points.
*****
> During regular trading Tuesday, the Dow advanced roughly 15 points to end the day at an all-time high. It was the 30-stock benchmark‚Äôs third straight day of gains and fifth positive session in the last six. Earlier in the session the Dow had jumped about 150 points to also hit a record intraday high.
*****
> The S&P gained 0.18% for its ninth positive session in the last ten, and also hit both a record intraday and closing high. It was the benchmark index‚Äôs 70th intraday high of 2021, and 57th record closing of the year.
*****
> The Nasdaq Composite gained 0.06% for its third positive session in four. Facebook weighed on the tech-heavy index, with shares of the social media company dipping 3.9%.
*****
> Microsoft and Alphabet were among the headline reports Tuesday after the market closed, with both topping revenue expectations. Microsoft shares rose 2.3% in premarket trading.
*****
> Texas Instruments shares tumbled 4% premarket after the company missed revenue estimates while Visa fell 2.5% despite beating on the top and bottom lines. Enphase Energy leaped 12.7% after reporting record revenue in face of supply chain headwinds.
*****
> Coca-Cola rose 2.6% premarket after the company posted a beat on the top and bottom lines and raised its outlook, saying the business was getting stronger particularly in areas where the Covid recovery has been the best.
*****

*****
> So far roughly 30% of the S&P 500 has reported earnings. Of the names that have posted quarterly updates, 82% have topped earnings expectations, while 80% have exceeded revenue estimates. Strong results have been key to pushing the major averages to new highs.
*****
> ‚ÄúWe see signs that there could be more gains to come in the final two months of the year,‚Äù said Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist for LPL Financial. ‚ÄúSeasonal tailwinds, improving market internals, and clear signs of a peak in the Delta variant all provide potential fuel for equities heading into year-end, and we maintain our overweight equities recommendation as a result.‚Äù
*****
> Robinhood shares were getting slammed, down 11% the day after the trading app reported revenue well below expectations primarily due to weakness in crypto trading.
*****
> A busy earnings week continues on Wednesday with Coca-Cola, McDonald‚Äôs, Bristol-Myers, Boeing, General Motors and Harley-Davidson among the names on deck before the market opens. Ford, eBay and Yum China will provide quarterly updates after the market closes.

U.S. stocks rose to record levels on Thursday as investors shrugged off economic data pointing slower-than-expected growth.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 200 points to hit an intraday record. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 rose 0.5%, also reaching a fresh high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite underperformed with a 0.3% gain amid a drop in Facebook and PayPal shares.

* Bitcoin rose 15% to its strongest level since mid-June on Monday.
* Positive remarks by Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Cathie Wood at ""The B Word"" event helped drive the gains.
* Chatter about Amazon possibly accepting bitcoin payments by the end of 2021 are seen as adding further support.

[Bitcoin](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/btc-usd?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) leapt 15% on Monday to rise above $38,000 for the first time in about six weeks, after remarks from influential commentators and a report that Amazon is considering accepting payments in the cryptocurrency helped restore bullish investor sentiment.

The coin was trading at around $38,750 as of 3:15 a.m. ET, representing a 33% gain so far this year. It had earlier hit a 24-hour high of about $39,544, its highest level since mid-June.

After being stuck in a descending slope for three months, bitcoin broke out at the top end of recent levels following [positive comments](https://www.businessinsider.com/bitcoin-price-predictions-crypto-cathie-wood-elon-musk-jack-dorsey-2021-7?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) from leading CEOs Elon Musk, Jack Dorsey, and Cathie Wood at ""The B Word"" event last week.

Tesla CEO Musk said the electric-vehicle maker would be open to accepting [bitcoin as payment again](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/elon-musk-bitcoin-approach-cathie-wood-jack-dorsey-bword-conference-2021-7?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral), as long as the mining community strives to move towards efficient energy use. Twitter boss Dorsey said that bitcoin is a big part of the social-media platform's future, and that he's working to make an accessible wallet for it via payments company Square.

A [report](https://www.cityam.com/amazon-definitely-lining-up-bitcoin-payments-and-token-confirms-insider/) from London's City A.M. about [Amazon](https://markets.businessinsider.com/stocks/amzn-stock?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) possibly accepting bitcoin payments by the end of 2021 also helped drive the digital currency's move higher. The roll-out may not take long, since the online retail giant has been working on these plans since 2019, a source told the newspaper, it reported.

Amazon is also looking to [hire someone](https://markets.businessinsider.com/currencies/news/amazon-digital-currency-crypto-blockchain-initiatives-ledger-lead-job-posting-2021-7?utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_medium=referral) to lead its digital currency and blockchain initiatives.

The re-emergence of institutional experts, along with Goldman Sachs' recent [services](https://www.coindesk.com/goldman-sachs-settling-crypto-etps-in-europe-sources) for institutional trades in bitcoin, helped drive the weekend rally for bitcoin, Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at OANDA, said in a note on Monday.

Lol stock market dweebs think they know why it‚Äôs pumping

This is literally your last chances get out of crypto before you see your money disappear.

Never have so many Governments and banking heads around the world from China, UK, Europe, US identified crypto (especially Bitcoin) as an entity to be crushed.  They are literally telling you point blank that they are going to crush Crypto.  They have never worked together like this before.

Their reasons are clear,  the anonymous nature of transactions leads crypto to organized crime and simply makes it too easy to hide revenue from the Government.  All Governments are worried about loosing tax revenue as a result of cryptocurrency transactions.

They are attacking crypto along several fronts.

1) Regulation.  Bring crypto exchanges into the current regulatory environment.  To crypto idiots, this looks like the establishment is finally going to adopt crypto. What it really does is setup legal arguments for the shutdown of these exchanges.  Why? Because there isn‚Äôt a crypto exchange on the planet that can meet organized crime regulations. They can‚Äôt, because crypto can‚Äôt be traced. 

2) the introduction of regulated crypto currency controlled by the central bank. This is competition, designed to remove any sort of public backlash from the imminent removal of crypto as any possibility as a currency of transaction, and pushes crypto to the fringes of use. It also reduces crypto to a single purpose, as an asset exchange between official currencies.  This removes any sort of demand for crypto by replacing it with something the establishment Iikes.  Once this is introduced, the closing of unregulated coins in exchanges will start.  This is where crypto exchanges will only be able to sell you those coins that meet organized crime regulation requirements.  Neither Bitcoin nor Ethereum will ever meet those requirements. 

3) the new crypto does advance currency transactions.  The Feds new digital currency for instance has the capability to simply make credit cards obsolete.  That‚Äôs quite a shift in the industry. It will make waves. The waves will be all about this new crypto coin and how amazing it is for online transactions that are no longer hemorrhaging revenue to credit companies. This is where Bitcoin and Ethereum should have been.. but they‚Äôll never be allowed to get there, Central bank heads have said this already, very explicitly.  ‚ÄúBitcoin will never be used as a currency for transactions‚Äù.  <=== Google this, and see who said it.   While stability is important, that‚Äôs not the primary reason, although it‚Äôs an often used excuse. The primary reason is about control.  Currency use has always been about control. 


Cathy Wood, and Elon Musk are not in a position to influence policy around the world, and they are not large enough forces to overcome the establishment with respect to the use of currencies.  These are not the people who can protect your money if what I described comes to pass. 

It‚Äôs your money.  I just felt I had to warn you. Don‚Äôt say the writing wasn‚Äôt out there as literally every central bank has been telling people to stay away from Crypto due to regulations.

Shorts had to cover

this false surge in based entirely on the Amazon rumor.  Bitcoin will crash back toward $30.000 in a day or two or three.  Can't believe there are still idiots buying Bitcoin.

Bezos not going to allow Bitcoin. That‚Äôs Bitcoin holders running with a rumor. No chance

what is the 52-week price performance?

Damn this reminds me of what happened with $DPW  that was wild

A short squeeze.

Why did it pump then, genius?"

ETFs have already started the buzz and I won‚Äôt settle for anything less than $100000

Right now the stock market is upwards of $50 trillion while crypto sits at $1 trillion, so they have the money, im ready.

If blackrock cannot trigger a BTC rally I don't know who can.

Having somebody with knowledge of the market to manage these investments more safely should be a great way for those people that are still too afraid to even touch crypto to start investing.

Grandpa BTC will rally when it wants to rally, and not a moment sooner

They can but the Bitcoin halving will drive it like every other cycle

tldr; Following a challenging year in 2022, positive signals are emerging for the future of Bitcoin (BTC). Institutional investors like BlackRock filing for a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) through the SEC has sparked optimism in the crypto market. This move marks a turning point in dispelling the notion of cryptocurrencies as a fleeting trend. Crypto adoption is slowly happening globally, and while Bitcoin ETFs have not ignited widespread interest, they have benefited crypto stocks. The trend of crypto stocks benefiting from Bitcoin ETFs may continue, but a spot Bitcoin ETF is critical for further mainstream acceptance. The performance of Bitcoin as a global reserve asset during recessions remains uncertain. Analysts suggest that Bitcoin could reach a price of $120,000 by the end of 2024, but volatility and market conditions can impact this forecast. Bitcoin's trading range in the next few years is expected to be influenced by factors such as central bank digital currencies, smart contracts, and public interest. Clarity on U.S. Bitcoin ETF approval, the classification of cryptocurrencies as securities, and the attractiveness of central bank digital currencies will significantly impact Bitcoin's trading range.

CryptoCurrency,Regulators Are Trying Turn Crypto Into Forex,"I used to trade forex over 10 years ago. There used to be a lot more brokers in the US. Also a lot of ECN overseas brokers accepted US residents. A lot of people in the US made a lot of money. They decided to crackdown on retail investors and shut down and fine many brokers. Now for the most part Forex trading is dead in the US. All the good ECN brokers are overseas and they all ban US traders because the US government makes it impossible for them to accept people from the US

So in the Land Of The Free we have two major forex brokers Oanda AKA regulated Market Maker and Forex.com. Google Forexpeacearmy and the name of each of those brokers for reviews. Almost all the reviews are negative with major fraud and theft of customer funds. Market makers are huge frauds and their number 1 goal is to steal your money and they will do anything to take it. They literally close your account if your a successful trader. 

It's not about protecting US citizens it's about control and all for them and none for us. It's all about fleasing US traders and taking their money. If you want to play with the big boys you need to be a corrupt banker or someone with power in the government. They want to do the same thing for crypto. They want to steal the technology and use it for evil. They could care less if you lose all your money.

Very close to how things in crypto are, I'd argue

This is exactly what satoshi nakomoto warned us about

Finally some content that makes sense. I absolutely agree, nothing good can come from regulation when the people making the rules are the ones being benefitted.

CryptoCurrency,(Proof) We have proof that institutions typically do NOT buy crypto during weekends/holidays!,"I have been suspecting for quite a while that institutions typically do **NOT** buy crypto during weekends/holidays.

Usually my comments get downvoted, and people say something like ""surely by now institutions have learnt to buy during weekends"", ""surely they have an intern working on weekends to press the buy button"".

Now we have proof!

>‚Äú**This could be an interesting weekend for bitcoin as much of the institutional money is expected to be dormant**,‚Äù said **Edward Moya, senior market analyst for the foreign-exchange broker Oanda**. ‚Äú**Weekend volatility has been somewhat of a story this year**, so many crypto watchers will look to see if any whales try to take advantage of illiquid conditions.‚Äù¬†¬†  
Source: [https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-ether-all-time-high-bitcoin-stalls](https://www.coindesk.com/market-wrap-ether-all-time-high-bitcoin-stalls)

Basically, for large institutions, buying crypto is likely not as easy as going to an exchange and pressing the ""buy"" button. Due to the large amount of money involved, there is likely to be multiple legal paperwork that needs to be filed, the big boss needs to approve, etc, all this is best done on a workday, i.e. Monday to Friday.

Even Elon Musk likely needs approval from the board of directors to buy crypto using Tesla's funds. Sure, if he buys using his own money he doesn't need approval, but if he is using company money he does.

# How this information is useful?

This info could be useful because it means that weekend dips are likely due to retail investors selling. It may not mean that institutional money is dumping. Hence, weekend dips are a good opportunity to buy the dip.

I‚Äôd imagine companies use bots to buy, honestly. i.e., it buys BTC every several seconds, and more so when the price dips 2%, 3%, etc. This would keep their average buy-in lower, and allow for flexibility on the balance sheet.

You think Goldman sachs is buying banano soon?

It is unlikely that Elon needs to go to the Tesla board for approval of every crypto purchase.  What they would do is authorize purchase of $XX billion (I'm dreaming) and leave it up to the corporate executive (Elon) to determine how and when to make the purchases.  *...so it's easily possible that even entities with oversight requirements are buying on weekends, if that is to their advantage.*

Unfortunately there's nothing conclusive in this thread, all sorts of people and algorithms buy and sell at different times.

Buy the High, sell the DIPPPP!!!!

Of course not, the 1% don‚Äôt work holidays lol.

Buy high sell higher!!!

CryptoCurrency,BBC News takes consistently bearish position on cryptocurrencies?,"I post this because I live in the UK and the BBC is without doubt the premier news website. Indeed some data suggests that it has [more traffic than any other news site in the world](https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/worldnews/2020/worlds-most-visited-news-site)

The BBC also has a special position in UK law as it is bound by a Royal charter which requires it to remain independent and have politically unbiased coverage of the news as a part of its mission to inform, educate, and entertain. It also has unique funding as UK resident TV licence fees contribute to their income.

It always catches my eye when the BBC News website publishes an article about cryptocurrencies. 15 hours ago they published this article.

[Dogecoin takes off after tip by Elon Musk](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-55939854)

Which goes into a lot of detail about the pitfalls of cryptoassets without covering the benefits:

‚ÄòHowever, with no intrinsic value like gold or land, and no ability to generate an income like a company or bond, cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile and can crash as fast as they rise.

This makes them hard to value and makes their prices susceptible to tips from backers or sudden panics.

Critics point out that while any given cryptocurrency may have a finite supply of units, the number of cryptocurrencies is ever-growing and potentially limitless.

People have lost large amounts of money in steep drops in the value of cryptocurrencies and in hacks and corrupted or lost hard drives.

Bitcoin's value dropped by $5,000 on 4 January to about $29,000 before recovering the lost ground. On 11 Jan, it dropped $9,000 to $32,000.

Because the cryptocurrencies can pass international borders quickly and are not regulated like cash or regular investments, investigating thefts is hard.

Last month, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) issued a stark warning to investors in so-called cryptoassets.

The financial watchdog said investors should be ""prepared to lose all their money"" should their investment's value collapse.‚Äô

Their previous article on the topic had a similarly doom-mongering headline:

[Cryptoasset investing? Be prepared to lose the lot, warns watchdog](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-55615514)

Although the text of the article was more cautionary, warning people of get-rich quick schemes and also potential fraudulent scam activity and I agree this is one aspect of the coverage which is definitely in the public‚Äôs interest.

A previous post about [bitcoin reaching its three-year high in November 2020](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-54982604) did mention its scarcity as an upside for investment but again mostly focused on the risks and downsides associated with cryptocurrencies:

‚ÄòBut Oanda's Mr Moya warned traders to prepare for more volatility.

""The amount of hedge funds and high-frequency trading systems driving Bitcoin higher will likely deliver exaggerated moves once its price nears the $20,000 level,"" he added. ""Traders need to expect $1,000 swings in a matter of minutes.""

Some believe the recent rise in Bitcoin is partly driven by the ""fear of missing out"" (FOMO).

""Its rebound is creating more interest from speculators and so they are jumping in which then pushes it even higher,"" added Mr Oliver.

""I think most people would put more faith in a digital currency run by their government rather than one like Bitcoin that they have trouble understanding or explaining."" ‚Äò

Of course, I understand that they are reporting this in an independent way and they have a duty not to take a position on long term market value, I feel that the positives of decentralisation, transactional transparency, and technological problem-solving which many cryptocurrencies offer are not covered in as much detail as the risks and downsides.

This has the potential end result of delaying mainstream adoption and making the public distrust the cryptocurrency market outright rather than taking a considered and balanced approach.

How do you think these issues can be tackled? I am a general supporter of the BBC‚Äôs news coverage but Surely one of the most widely read and trusted news sources in the world shouldn‚Äôt institutionally be a harbinger of so much negativity?

Else the general public don‚Äôt get a more complete informed view of this ever-developing field...


TL:DR - The BBC usually has fair and balanced reporting to properly inform the public. They seem to be consistently reinforcing the negatives with cryptocurrencies with limited reporting of the positives. I believe this is presenting an incomplete view to the public and is risking the public being less well informed. How can this be tackled?",https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ld2nel/bbc_news_takes_consistently_bearish_position_on/,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ld2nel/bbc_news_takes_consistently_bearish_position_on/,38,85,2021-02-05 08:10:32,pippius,"I have a consistently bearish position on the future of bbc

""However, with no intrinsic value like gold or land,""

This is a classic myth and has been answered in multiple FAQ's and papers and here many times.

I feel sorrow for the BBC, for a lot of my life they were a beacon of rationality against a wild and sensationalist British media. 

However over the last 10 years, the Conservatives and right wing media have beaten the impartiality right out of them. 

Cameron and Osborne used to regularly threaten them in public about pulling the license fee if they didn't tow the line, the board has since been stacked with Tory donors, and the new head of is, you guessed it, a massive Tory donor. 

Meanwhile every right leaning media outlet accuses them of extreme left bias, no matter how clear it is that facts show the opposite, and despite grit and determination, they're succumbing to it, moving further and further toward pro Government, pro Conservative opinions. 

They are now, from a news angle anyway, simply an authoritarian state media mouth piece. On other aspects they still produce some great content, but it won't last. Comedy will go, nature documentaries will go, radio is already being slimmed down, cut up, and original content removed in favour of repetition. 

And as always with right wing neoliberal Governments, it's the same path, undermine, de-fund, break apart, privatise.

It is really sad, they were such a fantastic institution Brits could be quietly proud of, but it has been ruined like so so many other things, by pure ideological fantasy. 

Edit: spelling, grammar, sentence structure

I think there's alo an underlying issue with the UK's finalcial regulators (I work im digital banking) as they can be quite hectic in regards to investment news.

Also BBC IS biased, even with the charter, and with their private funding coming kostky from international governments I'd be surprised if they took a pro-crypto sramce at this stage.

Utter lack of understanding the fundamentals. It‚Äôs not just a trade-able asset, these blockchain networks have purpose, the value they provide is what you should be assessing, this value generates positive or negative sentiment which affects the demand and with finite supply it affects the price directly. It‚Äôs common sense investing but the bbc can‚Äôt see that?

It is the same here in the Netherlands. Every news article (and Dutch public television) is not balanced at all. Always comparing it to a big bubble and comparing it to a casino where you will lose all your money. and of-course you should also remember that it is very bad for the environment.. 

I was reading another negative article on bitcoin some time ago on [NU.nl](https://NU.nl) (the biggest online news site in the Netherlands) After I finished the article it says in a very small font: This article is sponsored by the ING bank

Love that they specified the $5K and $9K drops bet left out and of the opposing rises. You can easily see they are listing two ‚Äúhigher lows‚Äù which is a bullish signal but how many average readers are going to see that aspect when it is worded to scare you about the massive drops? Certainly seems incredibly biased for a publication that has a government mandate to be independent. Shows crypto is still working towards the ‚Äúthen you win‚Äù phase.

#First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win

I noticed it was especially bad during the 2017 bull run. I'd say a lot of it comes from the journalists having no clue what they are writing about.

You ever listen to the Newscast podcast? They have done short pieces on Bitcoin recently and they were mostly positive, whilst still playing their impartiality nonsense.

Fuck the bbc
